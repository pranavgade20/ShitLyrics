[Verse 1]
Every time​ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah

[Interlude]
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

[Verse 2]
Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away


[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Bridge]
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream yourself a dream come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream come through
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on
Aaaaah!

[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Intro]
Now tell me the truth
Don't make me wait too long
You have to prove that I shouldn't move on

I'm sitting here watching the tick of the clock
I hear my own heartbeat, I want it to stop
Doing next to nothing except breaking apart
And this tension just cuts to the bone

Get out or give me reason
Shut up, I'll do it alone
And I won't waste another year sitting in here
I'm waiting for something more

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm just stuck here in the meantime
Waiting on the other line

[Chorus]
Now tell me the truth
Don't make me wait too long
You have to prove that I shouldn't move on
Giving in is the price I pay
These words alone hurt enough to walk away
You think I hang on everything you say
And worst of all, you're predictable


[Breakdown]
I really must be moving onward to something
I'm standing right here and I came from nothing
The harder you fall, the more pain you can take

[Bridge]
You love when the pressure just pulls me apart
You're fueling the fire, it just won't stop
It keeps growing and burning and taking my world down in flames

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Breakdown]

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2]
You're breaking the ground that you walk on
No one around you is safe
Your thoughts are as loud as a shotgun
They keep blowing me away
Away, away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
So we're just stuck here in the mean time
Waiting on the other line


[Chorus]

[Outro]
So we're just stuck here on the meantime
Waiting on the other line
[Verse 1: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the shadows where darkness crawls
And the spiderwebs between it all
We are the slither underneath your feet
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 2: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the pain of the rotten tooth
Of every child with hallow loot
We are the snake in your kitten's tree
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 3: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
Some with horns and some with fangs
A hundred eyes and giant brains
From the depths of the cosmic sea
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 4: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the fly in your baby food
Monsters of the foulest mood
We haunt every house and dream
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)
[Intro: Big Rube]
Yeah, you already know what it is (Swerve)
It's noisy off the set path
How can I make choices I've yet to discover we have?
Must need rehab
If you think you know me from the facets they show these folks to get money, I gotta laugh
How funny it is you don't realize the skill lies in knowing within the truth there's still lies
It's called being civilized
But not to trivialize your belief in the semi-fictionalized
I am who you see
What you hear is part of me
But there's so much more to me
So much more to be than just alive
A son, a brother, a husband, a father
But still can go even farther
Wish and will, can go harder
In that time, I went the hardest
More than this generic term "artist"
A reality smith, you love my craftsmanship
Because I craft some shit to make my people proud
And so I speak aloud, but not loud enough yet
Or as loud as I can get
They think I ain't a threat
But all preconceived notions, I've arrived
To Offset


[Chorus: Offset]
I was seventeen years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, and I wasn't rich, I had no workplace
My son, Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream

[Verse 1: Offset]
Kalea, you my first, first daughter
I missed the first years of your life, I'm sorry
Tell the truth, I ain't really know if I was your father
Tell the truth, I really don't even know your mama
But I had to step up, my daddy had left us
Even though we gotta catch up, pray to God that he bless us
I'ma keep grindin' for my kids, never gon' let up
I'ma put the money up for y'all, I can't be selfish
Had a baby as a kid, mama kicked me out
Had to go and hit a lick, tryna put food in your mouth
Then I got caught for the shit, in the pen when she pushed you out
Your mama tried to push me down, ain't let me stay at the house

[Chorus: Offset]
I was seventeen years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, and I wasn't rich, I had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream


[Verse 2: Offset]
I'm a father of four, gotta get that cash, gold
Keep my past closed, 'member I ain't had no dough
Spend a big bag on clothes, Gucci from the head to toes
Not two, not three, all four, that's all they know
Kulture, remind me of my grandma, feel like she is closer
Gotta thank your mama, she hold me like holsters
Gotta protect her from the world, I can't even post her
Ups and downs in this fame, roller coaster
If I don't ball, then everything 'round me fall
I'm prayin' to God to watch my kids, that's my all...

[Chorus: Offset]
I was seventeen years old when I had you (When I had you)
Tryna find my soul when I had you (When I had you)
I was oh so broke when I had you (When I had you)
Locked up down the road when I had you (When I had you)
Jordan, sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit, and I wasn't rich, I had no workplace
My son Kody, he three, rappin' already like me
Ridin' in the car, you don't play me, then he gon' scream
Me me, I be so on fire
Me me, cannot stand a liar said
Meet me, when the sun grow tired, they like why you so quiet who me me me?
Feed me, I'm the rapper eater, vintage shit, now the caps receding
I'ma need me, to pick myself up. Ain't that much, I'm like five three three
Fuck the hee-hee and the clown shit, ain't speakin' yo mind don't come round then
I'm tryna 3 peat they say it sound dim, keep my ears plugged, plug got the loud in
I'm tryna chief chief, she love the brown skin, hol up
Mayday mayday this ain't Townsville, so I'mma bcc you da message (phone vibration)
We dem niggas tho ain't no disrespectin'
Got my feet feet up, tree in da air, no time for scare pullin' receipts
Bare bones once they clout recede, (cloud) Cloud make em look like D League
Hao-ha
How I be da feces, I heard yo shit I give it 3 Z's
Im the sliced bread plus the bee's knees, they like who yo favorite Rey say me me me
I can't remember a wee geeked, 12 give me vibe a Elm Street
I said weed weed water same thang, 20 a G? Nigga hol up free-freeze me
Ice cold, hit the nitro, vice load, heavy as a ply flo', FICO prolly on the downtrend, I'ma pay ya give a nigga 1,2,3...
Dih for my blunt to be smoked, bout bright as a star who see, choke
Never me, coughin' up my lungs ain't no disease, it put me at ease
These niggas sleep (sleep), I got Assasin Creed sleeves, make em bleed bleed
Ama-Amazon, ain't got nun on this flow a bomb, ring alarm. Who the culprit?
Nigga, me me, I remember they ain't need me
Niggas quittin' cause its hard oh god, like who said it would be easy
Jugg, jugg gotta watch my step, every breath they utter greasy
Every dread got some power in it, oblivious niggas say peezy
Bet they women still gone please me, bring me seasons, roll up my Riddle Cs
I take the grav, over Hennessey, I take the green, over sippin' pink
This be that WuTang cream up in ya coffee, wake dese niggas up roaring like Mufasa
This whatever G shocked, watch ya Fossil, it be our time, can't a nigga stop it say
Me me, I love my aesthetic, me think they be so pathetic
Said me me, to the top I'm headed, you can meet me and you can get beheaded
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm too tired to be bored, I'm too bored to be tired
And the silence is so deafening, it's like picking at a sore
I'm too mental to go crazy, I'm too drunk to be pure
And my mind is playing tricks on me, and I can't sleep tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so tired, I can't take it anymore
And with all the liars, like a prisoner of war

[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy, I don't want your honesty
I just wanna get some peace of mind
It's only in my head as I roll over and play dead
I don't wanna hear it anymore

[Verse 2]
It's good to see you, but I really must admit
There's an odor in the air, and I think you look like shit
I can't stand for falling down, I'm too sick to throw up
Everyone keeps talking, and they can't shut the fuck up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so tired, I can't take it anymore
And with all the liars, like a prisoner of war


[Chorus]
I don't want your sympathy, I don't want your honesty
I just wanna get some peace of mind
It's only in my head as I roll over and play dead
I don't wanna hear it anymore

I don't wanna hear it anymore...

Man, I been asleep off the lean all day, it's like fuckin' mornin'
It already feel like it's nine in the mornin'

[Chorus]
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life
Gotta stay high, gotta stay high
Too low in my life, yeah, I gotta stay
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life, so I gotta stay high
Yeah, I gotta stay high
Too low in my, too low in my

[Verse 1]
Count the racks up (Huh), I got my stacks up (Ya' dig?)
Bad lil' bitch, tell her back up (Ya' dig?)
In the cut with the MAC tucked
Run up on me, get hit up
Ambulance needs to pick him up, uh
Six shots to the head like, woah
Run through the six, no woes
Throw money, throw hands, throw bows
Up, down, left, right, A, B, cheat codes
Pull up, my gun sing like Glee show
Rick Owen on my coat, no superhero
VVS my wrist like Sub-Zero
Play a bitch like guitar, no hero
Run the money up, stack it like Legos
Bad bitch wanna fuck, I say let's go, uh
R.I.P to my niggas gone
Sometimes I wish I could hit your phone
I don't really wanna walk through life alone
Ain't too many real niggas here no more
I lost my woadie, my heart cold
Now, I gotta walk through life alone
Now, I gotta walk through life alone
Now, I gotta live this life alone


[Chorus]
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life
Gotta stay high, gotta stay high
Too low in my life, yeah, I gotta stay

Too low in my life, so I gotta stay high
Yeah, I gotta stay high
Too low in my, too low in my (Ayy, huh)

[Verse 2]
Wockhardt in my body, I can't help myself, uh
I get so damn high that I can't feel myself
My girlfriend worried about me, think I'm gon' kill myself
Sorry, baby, I'm just really tryna feel myself
Keep my head above the water while I drown in wealth
I got that drip like Gunna, I may drip or drown myself
You know I love choppers, I had to surround myself
Takin' Gelato to the head, smoked the pound myself

[Chorus]
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life
Gotta stay high, gotta stay high
Too low in my life, yeah, I gotta stay
Hate it when they play both sides
Too low in my life, so I gotta stay high
Yeah, I gotta stay high
Too low in my, too low in my
[Intro]
Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"


[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"
Yeah what a piece a dilemma (oh gosh)

[Verse 1]
What is it you're waiting for?
You've got a chance to say it all
Tied your tongue and fucked it more
Glad you're not me
Cornered by your self-obsession
The hardest way to learn your lesson
(Is learning from me)

[Chorus]
Just 'cause someone says it's over
With their head upon your shoulder
And suddenly you're sober
All the things I wanna show you (show you)
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're sober

[Verse 2]
What is it you're waiting for?
You've got a chance to say it all
Get your kicks from someone else
Don't look at me
Take your time and tell me what you're thinking

[Chorus]
Just 'cause someone says it's over
With their head upon your shoulder
And suddenly you're sober
All the things I wanna show you (show you)
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're sober


Just 'cause someone says it's over
With their head upon your shoulder
And suddenly you're sober
All the things I wanna show you
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're sober
[Chorus: Loz Taylor with Mat Welsh]
Where is your heart? Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders, break the walls, together as one?
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps (Oh, oh-oh)
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit (Oh, oh-oh)
Are we free? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Are we all alone? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1: Loz Taylor &amp; Mat Welsh, Both]
If you gonna accuse me of pourin' too much salt in the wound
We have just proved that they can pollute our heads with the news
They will manipulate the masses again
If you gonna accuse me of tellin' you what you already knew
It's the same song sung with a different truth
And all of us forget it 'cause our head's inside the noose
They will manipulate the masses again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we won't forget it
You better pray for absolution
You can change but you can't deny
The new wave in a terror nation
Why do we ignore the warning signs?
Board it up, the borders are shut
The blood of the innocent is under the rug
White lies in a world corrupt
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
War will cease when we refuse to fight


[Chorus: Loz Taylor &amp; Mat Welsh, Both]
Where is your heart? Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders, break the walls, together as one?
The cruel hand of a faithless destiny that never sleeps (Oh, oh-oh)
The guiltless restraints assured by deceit (Oh, oh-oh)
Are we free? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Are we all alone? (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Are we all alone?

[Verse 2: Loz Taylor &amp; Mat Welsh]
Hope widows, shattered windows
Restriction without effect
Deadlines in silhouettes
Why do we ignore the warning signs?
Cold calls to derelict homes
Needles at the side of the road
Wires and liars like thorns that won't let go
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Tell me, where is your heart?

[Breakdown: Oli Sykes &amp; Loz Taylor]
I think the silence speaks volumes
Now, we march to our own drums
They're only singing what they want to be sung
Hate's become the new anthem
How could you?
When did our veins run numb?
We treat our species like a fuckin' flood
Hate's becomin' our new anthem


[Bridge: Loz Taylor with Mat Welsh]
The longer I live, I learn that we don't belong
We've taken more than we can give
And you'd do better on your own
The longer I live, I learn that we don't belong
We've taken more than we can give
And you'd do better, better on your own
Are we all alone?

[Outro: Mat Welsh with Loz Taylor]
Tear the borders, break the walls, take us back to when we're all
Together as one, taught to love, born to live and let go
Tear the borders, break the walls, take us back to when we're all
Together as one, taught to love, born to live and let go
[Verse 1]
I was walking through desert
The wind across my face
The heat upon my back
And somethings out of place

Tell me how I got here
I hope this is a dream
Things are getting crazy
And nothing’s as it seems

[Verse 2]
Time, it sped by
As I moved across the space
A flash before my eyes
And then gone without a trace

Like lightning through the sky
I traveled through the air
And was placed upon a rock
Overlooking what was there

(ohhh) And then I saw the people
(ohhh) They motioned with their hands
(ohhh) They said come follow us
All in time will be revealed and you’ll understand our plans


[Verse 3]
I was brought into a castle
It’s walls mighty and tall
It was filled with many treasures
That hung along the halls

And I stood before a King
With a crown upon his head
And he looked me in the eyes
And then this is what he said

[Chorus]
He said, I, was out my head, I was out of control
Thought I was living, but I wasn’t and
Sometimes, you crash and you burn
Before you're once again whole
Gather the pieces to the puzzle

Said, I, was out my head, I was out of control
Look in the mirror and you’ll see that
It’s not worth wasting your time
With things that destroy your soul
Gather the pieces to the puzzle

[Verse 4]
I stared straight at this man and I noticed something strange
Upon his withered hand there was written down a name
My mind began to open and I began to see
This wasn’t just man, but this withered king was me


But how did I get here and who had made me king
And who had build this castle and placed me in thing
He said, none of that now matters
But learn from what I speak
Then gently pulled me closer, as he was growing weak

[Chorus]
And said, I, was out my head, I was out of control
Thought I was living, but I wasn’t and
Sometimes, you crash and you burn
Before you're once again whole
Gather the pieces to the puzzle

Said, I, was out my head, I was out of control
Look in the mirror and you’ll see that
It’s not worth wasting your time
With things that destroy your soul
Gather the pieces to the puzzle

[Outro]
I, was out my head, I was out of control
Thought I was living, but I wasn’t and
Sometimes, you crash and you burn
Before you're once again whole
Gather the pieces to the puzzle


Said, I, was out my head, I was out of control
Look in the mirror and you’ll see that
It’s not worth wasting your time
With things that destroy your soul
Gather the pieces to the puzzle
[Verse 1]
Just one drink! Gonna keep it mellow
Responsible night for a polite fellow
Say, "Hello" to my friends and comrades
Don’t tend to offend so I say "Perhaps"
Just two drinks! As a social courtesy
We can raise a glass to our past fraternity
And certainly, a perfectly normal informal get together
But it’s been forever since we gathered so whatever
Just three drinks! For the sake of the old times
Proceed with tequila shots with a dish full of cold limes
The whole nine, laughing, remembering all the old lines
Never used to work but I could 'em give another try
Just four drinks! Y'know, take the edge off
I've had a hard week, I deserve to get sauced
Pick up another round as my friends depart and
They may not stick around but I just got started

[Chorus]
Feel so much better than usual
I feel indisputable, oh
I think that I might be beautiful

[Verse 2]
Just five drinks! Fuckin' treat myself
Pour the Dom Perignon from the back of the top shelf
Spend like God, put on airs to sell it
Crowd pretends not to care but I know they're jealous
Just six drinks! Let slip the dogs of war
I’m gonna start a fuckin' riot 'til I'm tossed out the front door
Zero to sixty, I can turn on a dime, I'm hitting bottom
And I'm feeling like committing a crime
Just eight drinks! Maybe I've lost count?
I can’t remember the night, what I drank or the amount
I’m fading in and out, my very consciousness is crumbling
Sorry, was I saying something?
Twelve drinks! Strolling out of the hospital
Is it hair of the dog if you stay drunk and don't stop at all?
Another night, losing it, more than I can afford
Was I just feeling bored? Am I that insecure?


[Chorus]
Feel so much better than usual
I feel indisputable, oh
But now I'm feeling so beautiful
Don’t wake me up from this spell I’m under if I'm still breathing
I know that I will be ugly when
I feel like myself again, oh
But now I'm feeling so beautiful

[Bridge]
Bottle of Scotch, served on the rocks with a shot of Cachaca
Vodka, Sake, kamikaze with a handle of Sherry
A cherry Brandy with a Jaeger, chaser, Champagne float
A Bourbon, hot Toddy in teacup of throat coat
Martini, Bellini, Negroni, Baileys, Kahlua, Sambuca
Soju, Paloma, Mojito, Gimlet, Frangelico, Guinness
Tequila, Manhattan, a Margarita, Old Fashioned
Dry Vermouth and something I can't taste 'cause I'm so trashed
Soldiering over, I'm slower, shoulder to shoulder with no one
Stumbling, sobering, making friends with a smoker
I know I'm less than upright, losing the fight with the ground
Then someone hits the lights as they close for the night now
Try to look at Heaven and I can't see the stars
A billion, trillion eyes are winking as I walk between parked cars
Metabolizing liquor while I'm losing my friends
I'm gonna hate myself tomorrow then I'll do it again


[Chorus]
Feel so much better than usual
I feel indisputable, oh
But now I'm feeling so beautiful
Don’t wake me up from this spell I'm under if I'm still breathing
I know that I will be ugly when
I feel like myself again, oh
But now I’m feeling so beautiful

[Outro]
My vision is blurry, as long as I'm thirsty
Nobody can hurt me, hurt me, hurt me
[Verse 1: Jack]
"No thank you" is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come

[Pre-Chorus: Jack]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And "no thank you" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus: All]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
(Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that)


[Verse 2]
No thank you
They call me after dark, I don't want no part
My habits, they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge

[Pre-Chorus: Jack]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And "no thank you" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that

[Bridge]
We, we fall for that
Wake up, we fall again
We, we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again


[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And no thank you is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

[Chorus]
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
Go!
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya
But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee yaaaaa
[Verse 1]
Is this metal enough for you?
Is it heavy enough, destructive enough?
Am I dead enough for you?
Am I tough enough, corrupt enough?

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I bloody enough?
Am I fucking enough?

[Chorus]
Can I be, can I be one of the cool kids? (You're the dumbshits)
All I ever wanted to be is one of the brightest motherfucking falling stars
Can I be, can I be one of your heroes? (Zeroes)
Can somebody tell me
Am I the top of the bottom
Or the bottom of the top?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Is this empty enough for you?
Is it ugly enough, destructive enough?
Am I angry enough for you?
Your time is up, don't give a fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I bloody enough?
Am I fucking enough?


[Chorus]
Can I be, can I be one of the good guys? (You're the bad guys)
All I ever wanted to be is one of the brightest motherfucking falling stars
Can I be, can I be one of your heroes? (Zeroes)
Can somebody tell me
Am I the top of the bottom
Or the bottom of the top?

[Bridge]
Long live the fallen idols
All moths into the flame
You're chasing your own shadows
Are you not entertained?
Long live the fallen idols
All moths into the flames
You're chasing your own shadow
Are you not entertained?

[Chorus]
Can I be, can I be one of the cool kids? (You're the dumbshits)
All I ever wanted to be is one of the brightest motherfucking falling stars
Can I be, can I be one of your heroes? (Zeroes)
Can somebody tell me
Am I the top of the bottom?
Can I be, can I be one of the good guys? (You're the bad guys)
All I ever wanted to be is one of the brightest motherfucking falling stars
Can I be, can I be one of your heroes? (Zeroes)
Can somebody tell me
Am I the top of the bottom
Or the bottom of the top?


[Outro]
Top
Bottom of the top
Yeah, bottom
Yeah, bottom of the top
[Verse 1]
If all the clouds become our enemies
And the rain begins to fall
And the rain begins to fall
Would you still be there standing next to me
With our backs against the wall
With our backs against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
But darling when the sky is dark
I still see it clearly
I see you

[Chorus]
Even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close
And whenever I walk too far
You'll still be my home
Honey there's no easy part
No matter what you're told
But even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close

[Verse 2]
For all the times we've had our differences
And the tears began to fall
And the tears began to fall
We've always made it too the final step
To look back at it all
God damn we've seen it all


[Pre-Chorus]
But darling when the sky is dark
I still see it clearly
I see you

[Chorus]
Even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close
And whenever I walk too far
You'll still be my home
Honey there's no easy part
No matter what you're told
But even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close

[Outro]
Even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close
And whenever I walk too far
You'll still be my home
[Verse 1]
I’ve been leaving your shampoo bottles
Over in the corner there
Sitting empty on the bathtub rail
Wishing they could wash your hair

Yeah, I keep em by that crumb of fancy soap
And your toothbrush at my bathroom sink
Your cell phone chargers still hanging from the wall
Haven’t chucked it all, like you'd think
Though you haven’t been around in weeks

[Verse 2]
I’ve run out of my Speed Stick, honey
So I have been using yours
It's frickin trash, all that organic hoo hah
From one of your health food stores

It is seemingly worsened everyday
All this shit of yours around my house
If I could’ve had it any other way
Then by now I would’ve chucked it out
But it seems to wanna stick around

[Chorus]
I’ve been leaving you in radio silence
Though I’d love to catch a pass
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby, how fucked is that?
And it’s all just so forgettable
Til I’m sitting with your stuff alone
Man, why can’t I just let it go?


[Verse 3]
I’ve been seeing that red Corolla parked out on the corner there
If it were yours, there’d be some hippie bullshit hanging from the rearview mirror

As I’m passing it every other day
I look in to see if this one’s yours
But the shape it’s in is giving it away
Yours is dented up and down the doors
Never wanted to see it more

[Chorus]
I’ve been leaving you in radio silence
Though I’d love to catch a pass
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby, how fucked is that?
And it’s all just so forgettable
Til I’m sitting with your stuff alone
Man, why can’t I just let it go?
Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Uh, anxiety is bad for the soul (Ooh, yeah)
Pills and anxiety, they take control (Ooh, uh)
Anxiety is bad for the soul (Ooh, uh)
Pills and anxiety, they take control, yeah (Uh)
Bad timing, stars aligning
Lost in my abyss, please, someone find me (Uh)
Bad timing, stars aligning
They don't wanna see me win, crucify the kid

[Verse 1]
Feeling terrible, unbearable pain (Oh, ah, ah)
Lost in my head, yeah, losing my brain
Everybody out to get me, they're abusing my brain
Even when I'm doing drugs, shit, it don't feel the same
Uh, beautiful, uh, incredible pain
No matter how hard I try, can't get other people to change
Oh, she beautiful, see her through my cubicle (Ayy)
She still got a lot to learn, so do I, so it's okay

[Bridge]
You ain't right all the time, neither am I
I need you by my side, right now, I feel drained (Drained)
You're the only that can convince me that I won't die
You end my movie, happily, I'm out that Nicolas Cage


[Chorus]
Uh, Anx...
[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Hey, you little piss baby
You think you're so fucking cool? Huh?
You think you're so fucking tough?
You talk a lotta big game for someone with such a small truck
Aw, look at those arms
Your arms look so fucking cute, they look like lil' cigarettes
I bet I could smoke you, I could roast you
And then you'd love it and you'd text me "I love you"
And then I'd fucking ghost you

[Chorus: Laura Les]
With the big boys coming with the big stuff
I feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the picture
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah (oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Laura Les]
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine


[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
Tell me what's the deal, I've been tryin' to go to bed
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone
Tell me what's the deal, I've been tryin' to go to bed
I've been up for days, I've been tryna get ahead
Said it all before, and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone

[Chorus: Laura Les]
With the big boys coming with the big stuff
I feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah
Big boys coming with the picture
Feel so clean like a money machine, oh yeah (oh yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Laura Les]
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
[Verse 1]
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

[Chorus]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Verse 2]
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake


[Chorus]
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

[Bridge]
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

[Refrain]
Hurry, I'm worried

[Outro]
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie
[Verse 1]
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like to be hated
To be fated to telling only lies

[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

[Verse 2]
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through

[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

[Bridge]
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover, L.I.M.P., say it
Discover


[Verse 3]
No one knows what it's like to be mistreated
To be defeated behind blue eyes
No one knows how to say that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not tellin' lies

[Chorus]
But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

[Outro]
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
[Verse 1]
I wish there was a situation to be mad at
Or a person I could blame
I've got a loud mouth, I'm pale with a ghost obsession
But behind the scenes with her I'm playing 21 Questions
There's gotta be a reason
You keep your guy in hiding
I'm becoming what I've hated
But your talk is so inviting

[Pre-Chorus]
But then what?
You drop your guy and take me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?

[Chorus]
My mood's dictated by our conversations
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
I want you all to myself this time, t-t-time
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
Want you all to myself this time, t-t-time

[Verse 2]
I never have to
Carefully shape sentences
When I've got some words to say
They're falling from my mouth from the time
That they hit my brain
'Cause we built a picture made for frames
We live in chemistry away from all the wasted time and taste


[Pre-Chorus]
But then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?

[Chorus]
My mood's dictated by our conversations
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
I want you all to myself this time, t-t-time
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
Want you all to myself this time, t-t-time

[Bridge]
We built a picture made for frames
We live in chemistry away from all the wasted time and taste
And it sucks to sleep
'Cause you aren't talking to me
I wanna give you space
But the amount between us is wrecking me

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?
'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?
'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Am I in his position now?
'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?


[Chorus]
My mood's dictated by our conversations
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
I want you all to myself this time, t-t-time
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
Want you all to myself this time, t-t-time

[Outro]
I'll forget you if you need me to
Like nothing ever happened
My sun still sets without you
Like nothing ever happened
[Verse 1:]
"Abigail! I know you're in control of her brain, Abigail!
And I know that you're the one that's speaking through her
Abigail!
Miriam, can you hear me??"
"I am alive inside your wife
Miriam's dead. I am her head...."
"Abigail! Don't you think I know what you've done, Abigail?!
I'll get a priest! He will know how to get her soul back!"
"Oh, Jonathan! This is Miriam!
Our time is out!

[Verse 2:]
Remember the stairs! It's the only way!"
"Abigail! Nothing I can do but give in, Abigail...."
"Jonathan, I agree.... Yes I do...."
"I am alive inside your wife
Miriam's dead. I am her head....
Soon I'll be free!!!"
[Verse 1]
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Verse 2]
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn


[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Refrain]
No time to die, mmm
No time to die, ooh

[Outro]
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Hook]
Die freie Sicht genießen
Wenn man am Abgrund steht
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Es fühlt sich an wie Fliegen
Wenn sie uns fall'n seh’n
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön

[Part 1]
Kleiner Junge neben Mama vor dieser Frau am Schalter:
„Sag, warum guckst du denn so traurig, Kleiner?“
Die Frage kennt er schon, sie laufen weiter, als läge über ihm
Ein grauer Schleier, der verhindert dass er nach außen scheinen kann
Und auf der Leinwand, sieht er perfekte Menschen
Mit Siegerlächeln, die glänzen und alles mit guter Laune meistern
Es braucht 'ne Weile, ihn aufzuheitern, doch Mama sagt:
„Auch der Pausenclown hat Augen, die mal geweint haben“
Die anderen haben's auch nicht einfach, nur traut’s sich keiner
Da draußen zu zeigen - traurig und einsam sind doch nur Außenseiter
Es kommt nicht darauf an, wer lauter schrei'n kann
Auch zuhör'n kann den Raum bereichern und Frauen begeistern
Was du siehst, sieht kaum ein Zweiter
Du erkennst die Magie in der Melancholie, also zauber einfach
Im Lauf der Zeit fällt das Laufen leichter
Und du begreifst, da liegt Schönheit in allem, auch im Scheitern


[Hook]
Die freie Sicht genießen
Wenn man am Abgrund steht
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Es fühlt sich an wie Fliegen
Wenn sie uns fall'n seh'n
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön

[Part 2]
Hallo Schmerz! Ist lange her, dass du mich
Zum aller ersten Mal gelehrt hast: „Junge, du kannst nicht mehr“
Die Ambulanz vorm Ascheplatz hat gedacht, ich sterb'
Die Spannungsherde im Kopf und der erste Cut ins Herz
Hab' bald gemerkt es gibt Sachen, die kann kein Arzt entfern'n
Wurd’ abgehärtet und hab’ mich lange von Hass ernährt
Ich dachte mehr als nur einmal „Ist das dein fucking Ernst?!“
Doch manches Drama war hinterher nur ein'n Lacher Wert
Haben uns angenähert und zusamm’n gelernt
Nie mehr will ich dich betäuben, auch wenn du manchmal nervst
Ach Schmerz, ab und an hab ich dich ehrlich gern
Wanderer über dem Scherbenmeer

[Hook]
Die freie Sicht genießen
Wenn man am Abgrund steht
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Es fühlt sich an wie Fliegen
Wenn sie uns fall'n seh'n
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön


[Bridge]
Immer wieder Anlauf nehmen
In jedem Waldbrand einen neuen Anfang sehen
Immer dann merken, dass man lebt, wenn das Blatt sich dreht
Weil der Sturm jeden Plan zerschlägt
Wenn sich das Dunkle in mir mit den guten Dingen verkoppelt
Naturidylle, Tschernobyl
Ich such' das Weite, bin gerne alleine
Um mir mal alles von der Seele zu Schweigen

[Hook]
Die freie Sicht genießen
Wenn man am Abgrund steht
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Es fühlt sich an wie Fliegen
Wenn sie uns fall’n seh'n
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Wir sind anders schön
Wir sind anders schön

[Verse: Rhys Taylor]
It's late and I'm awake, starin' at the wall
Open up my window, head floats out the door
No one else around, the shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head, blinded by the sky
Feel my weight in front, followin' the sound
Moves away so fast, fall down to the ground
I know there's more to come, jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me, chasin' down the street
(Down the street, down the street, down the street, down the street, down the...)

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
(Oooh, oooh)


[Chorus: Rhys Taylor]
Gave my love to a shootin' star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasin'
I'm in love with a shootin' star
But she moves so fast, when she falls, then I'll be waitin'
Gave my love to a shootin' star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasin'
I'm in love with a shootin' star
But she moves so fast, when she falls, then I'll be waitin'
Gave my love to a shootin' star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasin'
I'm in love with a shootin' star
But she moves so fast, when she falls, then I'll be waitin'
Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gunna die
Everybody's gotta live
I think you know the reason why

Sometimes the going gets so good
Then again it gets pretty rough
But when I have you in my arms baby
You know I just can't, I just can't get enough

(Oh yeah)

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gunna die
Everybody's try to have a good time
I think you, I think you know the reason why

I saw a blind man standing on the corner yesterday baby
He couldn't hardly tie his shoes
But he had a harmonica and a guitar strapped around his neck, and he sure could
He sure could play the blues

(Oh Yeah)

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gunna die
Everybody's try to have a good time
I think you know the reason why


I feel like I've seen just about a million sunsets
She said if your with me ill never go away
That's when I stopped and took another look at my baby
She said if your with me ill never go away

(Because)

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gunna die
Everybody's gotta live
Before you know the reason why

I had a dream the other night baby
I dreamt that I was all alone
But when I woke up I took another look around my self
And I was surrounded by fifty million strong

(Oh yeah)

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gunna die
Everybody's gotta live
I think you know the reason why

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gunna die
Everybody's gotta live
(You Gotta Live!)
And everybody's gunna
(Choking sounds) die
Das Ding ist, für die Leute die sogar noch klüger scheissen als ich
Ihr seid die Größten ihr könnt alles ihr seid so schlau
Ihr wißt immer alles besser und ihr habt immer recht
Ihr kritisiert alles vom Barmann bis zur Klofrau
Ihr seid die Meister dieser Welt ihr wißt immer woran es fehlt
Trotzdem seid ihr die, die nichts tun und zuschauen
Es gibt nichts was euch gefältt, von dem was andere schaffen
Ein Tip von M &amp; N: Fress halten - selber machen

Das geht raus an die Hater, an die Besserwisser kommt macht's euch selber
Ihr meint ihr wißt wies geht aber wer nichts macht, macht keine Fehler
Wer kann alles, wer hat Recht, wer is der Meister, wer ist perfekt
Wer's der Beste, wer's der Chef, ich glaub du hast dich überschätzt

Wer ist der, der alles kann, der Fünf-Millionen-Dollar-Mann?
Ein Gruß an dich vom Niggimann, F.H.S.M
Du bist so inaktiv, rhetorisch gut aber passiv
Du findest fast alles mies F.H.S.M
Über dich muß man lachen, du bist Meister aller Klassen:
Klugscheißer, Besserwisser, F.H.S.M
Ich liebe Fehler so wie selbstgemachte Apfeltaschen
Oder meine eigenen Platten F.H.S.M

Ihr redet permanent von Frieden während alles brennt
Wir haben die Lösung daß Patent heißt F.H.S.M
Das Sparprogramm ist so präsent doch die Merkel fährt nen Benz
Spart doch mal im Parlament F.H.S.M
Die Amis haben Atomprogramm wie Korea und Iran
Wer steigt aus? Wer fängt an? F.H.S.M
Ich weiß schon daß du reden kannst doch das allein ist noch
Nicht spannend, mir fehlt ein bißchen Tatendrang. F.H.S.M


Das geht raus an die Hater...

Ich sitze am Steuer und du sagst mir wie ich fahren soll
Spar dir deine guten Tipps F.H.S.M
Du meinst die Party ist zu teuer und auch viel zu voll
Du magst nicht wie der DJ mix F.H.S.M
Du weißt wie man Texte schreibt, danke das ist nett gemeint
Aber nett ist wohl das Gegenteil. F.H.S.M
Wenn du es wirklich besser weißt, ich hab Stift und Heft dabei
Komm liefer mir doch den Beweis F.H.S.M

Du willst mich dissen, geh nach Hause und heule ins Kissen
Hey der Reim ist doch beschissen, F.H.S.M
Und liebe Kritiker schreibt über Roger Whittaker
Der Reim ist noch beschissener. F.H.S.M
Fragt doch unseren Soundmann ob er das nicht besser kann
Der schlägt erst zu und denkt sich dann F.H.S.M
Wenn ich mir dann einen baue dann kommt Meister Oberschlau
Erzählt mir was von inside-out. F.H.S.M

Das geht raus an die Hater...

Du weißt wie man renoviert, du sagst mir wie man tapeziert
Aber hilfst mir nicht und trinkst mein Bier. F.H.S.M
Ich lade dich zu mir ein, koch dir Essen, kauf dir Wein
Du meinst es könnte besser sein. F.H.S.M
Du findest die Texte zu populistisch, politisch aber zu nichtig
Achtung, wichtig für dich, F.H.S.M
Ich weiß ihr seid gerne kritisch aber bleibe konstruktiv
Ansonsten bitte, bitte F.H.S.M
Ihr seid die Meister dieser Welt ihr wißt immer woran es fehlt
Trotzdem seid ihr die, die nichts tun und zuschaun
Es gibt nichts was euch gefällt, was andre schaffen
Ein Tipp von M &amp; N: F.H.S.M


Das geht raus an die Hater...

Watashi nani mo ienakute naita no
Utsumuita kono odeko tonton tataita no wa
Kimi nano kana? Chigau no kana?

[Chorus: MC God]
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight‚ I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God‚ she got them big ass titties‚ she's only five (Ayy, ayy)
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight‚ I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God, she got them big ass titties, she's only five‚ ayy

[Verse 1: MC Prophet]
Bitch, I'm boutta fuck this cutie so I whip out my katana
And I knock this lil' bitch out with just one hit like I'm Saitama
Why you act like you retarded? Like lil' bitch, I don't want drama
I still hit when she says "No," don't understand when she don't wanna, ayy
Sword fighting with my penis like I'm in a fuckin' dojo
All these bitches want me like my name was fuckin' JoJo
Asian penis is too tiny like it was a no show
Bitch don't want your coochie, watch anime with the bros though


[Verse 2: Wonder]
Sailor Moon my motherfucking bitch
I might pull up, give those thighs a little motherfucking kiss
And, man, if you talking shit tell Ryuk you on the list
Yeah, your sister is my groupie, she take this anime dick
Okay, okay, like little bitch, I don't care if that fat ass is 2D
Score a bounty on that pussy, you can call me Spike Lee
Puttin' out fire, gettin' ice, bitch, I'm Todoroki
And if you got some shit to say then you can say it to me

[Chorus: MC God]
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight, I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God, she got them big ass titties, she's only five (Ayy, ayy)
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight, I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God, she got them big ass titties, she's only five (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 3: MC Prophet]
Asuna, Asuna, Mikasa, please
Can you just give me head? Please, just get on your knees
Bitch, I'll beat up that ass like my name is Bruce Lee
And I'll eat up that pussy like I'm Kaneki, ayy
Asian people driving, are they even trying?
I be buying all this hentai so I jerk it, I'm not lying
Now I'm sighing 'cause I want Hatsune Miku, now I'm crying
When I fuck anime bitches I'll be moaning and be whining, ayy


[Bridge: MC Prophet]
Thick thighs look sexy even when especially she decides to wear her dress
Uwu, nuzzles on my neck
Now we layin' on the bed
Man, I love my body pillow especially givin' head
You know what’s next

[Chorus: MC God]
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight, I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God, she got them big ass titties, she's only five

[Outro]
Tehehehehe, that was gay
[Intro: Tilian]
Forget my jealousy
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said
"We own the night"

[Chorus: Jon Mess &amp; Tilian]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger (Night)
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Let your hair down, have one more round, drink 'til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes, baby, this is living
Roller coaster, up and down in random motion
Oh, come in closer, ditch your problems, better days are coming
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment and live now, live now
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment, feel it now


[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night

[Chorus: Jon Mess &amp; Tilian]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger (Night)
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall
You'll forget I'm wrong

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Call your phone and open up my fate
'Cause I know you're so connected
I need poison, mitigate my pain
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Give me false hope in my veins
Tranquilize and modify my brain

[Bridge: Tilian &amp; Jon Mess]
Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do, the thrill is gone
(Wake up, you're dead, you're gonna go)
So I play these nervous songs
Pretend that I’m not barely hanging on
(Wake up, you're dead, you're gonna go)
And medicate, medicate, medicate me all night long
Medicate, medicate, medicate me all night long
(You're dead, you're dead, you're dead now)


[Outro: Jon Mess]
I run quickly out of air
By the way, I hate your celebration
I run quickly out of air
By the way, I hate our aging faces
[Piano Intro]

[Intro]
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade..."
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on, and in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it


[Verse 2]
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

[Chorus]
To carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on, and though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Bridge]
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

[Post-Chorus]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care!


[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on, and though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Post-Chorus]
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on!)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on!)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on!)
Go and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry-)
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on...)

[Intro]
Alli- Alligatoah
Ich bin verliebt
Sieht man doch

[Part 1]
Es ist eine wunderschöne Sommernacht
Ich chill mit Kontrabass im Monstertruck
Vergrabe Nudeln und ihr fragt mich wozu
Denn ich lache und beginne, aus der Nase zu bluten
Guck mal, seit Tagen red ich lediglich mit Fabelwesen
Ich sammel Fotos meiner schönsten Grafikfehler und ihr sagt, ich wäre
Seltsam geworden, ja ja ve ve
Ich sitze da und les AGBs
Verrückt, ihr wollt ein beschissenes Spiel?
Glotze aus, ich trinke jedesmal, wenn nix passiert
Und dann raus auf den Balkon, ich brülle Nazitexte
Sorry, hab mich grade mit dem Papst verwechselt
Damn Girl, weil du hinreißend bist
Tätowier ich dein Gesicht in mein Gesicht
Mir ist alles scheißegal, ich würde Kinder erschießen
Was blind? Ich bin geistig behindert vor Liebe

[Hook]
Dann stand sie einfach so da
Ist sie der heilige Gral?
Oder nur heiße Gefahr?
Wer weiß?
Ich muss sie treffen sofort
Werd ich dann lächelnd umsorgt?
Oder mit Messern durchbohrt?
Wer weiß?


[Part 2]
Extrablatt: Verseuchte Gewässer, will mich entschuldigen
Doch sage: Hurensohn! Freudscher Versprecher
Ich habe neulich im Affekt Medizin studiert
Und dennoch weiß ich nix von ihr außer: Ich liebe mmm
Zurück zur Ironie, guck, ich bin Schnäppchenjäger
Und mach mir 'ne Geschlechts-OP klar - YOLO!
Ich werde nie zur Ruhe komm'n
Auf Fotos siehst du mich nur verschwomm'n
Ihr sagt, ich hab mehr Craziness als das gelähmte Kind
Das auf Kekse wichst - hahaha, versteh ich nicht
Irgendwas hat mein' Schädel-Innenraum zerstört
Jetzt hab ich sogar mit dem Trinken aufgehört - Was soll ich tun?!
Suizid scheidet aus, denn Marktforscher wissen
Ihr würdet Alligatoah vermissen
Aber mäh' ich wieder Rasen solltet ihr euch in den Zimmern verkriechen
Was blind? Ich bin geistig behindert vor Liebe

[Hook]
Dann stand sie einfach so da
Ist sie der heilige Gral?
Oder nur heiße Gefahr?
Wer weiß?
Ich muss sie treffen sofort
Werd ich dann lächelnd umsorgt?
Oder mit Messern durchbohrt?
Wer weiß?


[Bridge]
Ich handel nicht mehr rational - Robben schlachten!
Ich habe keine andre Wahl - Robben schlachten!
Liebe macht doch krank, ich darf Robben schlachten!
Humor ist: Trotzdem lachen
Ich handel nicht mehr rational - Robben schlachten!
Ich habe keine andre Wahl - Robben schlachten!
Liebe macht doch krank, ich darf Robben schlachten!
Humor ist: Trotzdem lachen


Ha-Ha-Ha

[Hook]
Dann stand sie einfach so da
Ist sie der heilige Gral?
Oder nur heiße Gefahr?
Wer weiß?
Ich muss sie treffen sofort
Werd ich dann lächelnd umsorgt?
Oder mit Messern durchbohrt?
Wer weiß?
[Hook]
Scheiße! In meinem Keller liegt ne Leiche
Ich bin's nich' gewesen, doch ich kann es nich' beweisen
Scheiße! Überall ist Blut, doch ich hab es nich' getan
Wie werde ich sie los, hat da jemand einen Plan?
Auf meinem Sofa liegt ein Toter
Ich bin's nich' gewesen und es ist auch nich' mein Opa
Scheiße! Überall ist Blut, doch ich hab es nich' getan
Wie werde ich sie los, hat da jemand einen Plan?

[Part 1: Beatzarre]
Ich war im Baumarkt, denn ich will da ma' nachfragen
Ob sie nich' ne große Kiste, sowas wie 'nen Sarg haben
Oder ob es reicht wenn ich sie bloß zerlege
Mit dem Häcksler im Garten oder der Motorsäge
Und dann lad' ich meine Freunde ein, zum Barbecue
Es gibt Fleisch für alle, komm - schlag ruhig zu
Oder ich bau ein Wintergarten und gieß' sie in Beton
Oder baue 'ne Rakete und schieße sie zum Mond
Ey ich leg sie in die Tiefkühltruhe, weil sie da keiner sehen kann
Und ich hol sie raus, im Winter, und bau daraus 'en Schneemann

[Hook]

[Part 2: Sido]
Mit 'nem dicken Schädel wach ich auf
Mein ganzes Bett ist nass
Ich weiß nichts mehr
Ich glaub ich hab die letzte Nacht komplett verpasst
Ich sag: Lieber Tag wird bitte nich' schlimmer
Doch aufm Weg ins Bad, liegt da ne Leiche mitt'n im Zimmer
Was soll'n das jetzt? Kommt der klar?
Was denkt dieser Arsch sich?
Liegt hier rum als hätte ich ihn umgebracht, doch ich war's nich'
Sag ma, muss er unbedingt mit seinem Blut den Boden rot färben?
Wie konnte er bloß sterben? Ich muss ihn los werden
So, zurück zum Sender, ihrem Schreiben liegt ne Leiche bei
Oder schneid' dir ne Scheibe von ihm ab, in meiner Fleischerei
Ich leg zu den Pennern unter die Brücke, die stört das selten
Oder ich stell sie zu diesen Statuen bei Körperwelten
Ich glaub da hilft kein Copperfield und auch kein Uri Geller
Nein, ich pack sie einfach zu den anderen in meinem Keller
Die Leute kommen, die Leichen gehen, wie das so ist im Leben
Und dann zurück an den Tresen, so als sei nichts gewesen


[Hook]

[Part 3: Dag]
Ich weiß ich hab es nich' getan, aber keiner wird mir glauben
Also mache ich 'nen Plan
Ich schick sie nach Afghanistan, ab in den Irak
Das fällt da garnich' auf, da sterben Massen jeden Tag
Ich schick sie in den Bundestag, mit dem Paketzusteller
Denn jeder Politiker hat Leichen in seinem Keller
Ich warte bis zum nächsten Amoklauf und deponier' sie in der Aula
Das fällt da garnich auf zwischen Max und der Laura
Und dann hab ich ma gegooglet, Organe bringen Geld ein
Ich verkauf die Einzelteile, aus jedem Teil mach ich 'nen Geldschein

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Doch die Lösung liegt viel näher als man denkt
Ich warte einfach bis mein Nachbar pennt
Dann schleiche ich mich heimlich in sein Haus
Und lege ich ihm die Leiche einfach auf die Couch

[Hook]Folg RapGeniusDeutschland!
[Part 1]
Scheiß egal eh..
Das Gesetz bedeutet nix für mich
Ich geb schon immer nen Fick drauf was richtig ist
Ich hab 'ne große Fresse auch wenn du ein Grizzly bist
Mein Freund ich bin wie ich bin man es ist wie's ist
Ich hab 'ne Abneigung gegen Lehrer und 'ne Sechs in Mathe
Ich hab's ihm einfach weggenommen wenn er was besseres hatte
Ich behalt alles für mich, ich geb nie ab
Ich scheiß' auf Mitleid und Gefühle ich geb 'n Fick
Ich bin unberechenbar, ich lass nicht mir mir reden
Ich hab kein Problem damit die Kasse mitzunehmen
Und dir 'nen Tritt zu geben wenn du mich stresst du Penner
Denn wir hier bei der Sekte regeln das wie echte Männer
Homeboy ich kann es seh'n du würdest gerne sein wie ich
Du würdest alles tun für ein Leben aus meiner Sicht
Denn deins ist langweilig, du bist brav wie immer
Und ich geh ab los mach's mir nach du Spinner

[Hook]
Ich bin all das wovor deine Eltern
Dich immer gewarnt haben
Doch ich hab Geld, hab Frauen, hab Spaß
Und du musst immer noch Bahn fahren
Ich bin ein schlechtes Vorbild
Na und wer sagt was schlecht ist?
Ich passe nicht in dein Konzept
Egal mir geht es prächtig
Pass gut auf, hör mir zu, mach's mir nach
(Mach's mir nach du Spinner!)
Ich bleib so wie ich bin egal was ihr sagt


[Part 2]
Mein Körper ist eine Ruine, denn ich nehm' viele Drogen
Immer wenn ich high bin mutiere ich zum Philosophen
Die Welt ist klein, denn ich betrachte sie von oben
Ich bin unerzogen, abgehoben, haut ab ihr Idioten
Ich trinke wie ein Loch doch das ist meine Sache
Warum ist das ein Problem? Weil ich's nicht heimlich mache?
Ich bin immer ehrlich und ja ich bin gefährlich
Ich nehm den Laden auseinander und tu so als wär nix
Ich hab kein Respekt, ich bin zu keinem nett
Und wenn dein neues Handy weg ist, hab ich's eingesteckt
Ich bin ein Rüpel, ein Raudi und ich kann Nerven sägen
Gib mir 'ne Glotze und 'nen Joint, ich brauch nicht mehr zum leben
Man sucht mein Herz vergebens, ich kann keinem trauen
Das ist der Ernst des Lebens? Erstmal einen bauen
Ich schwing an der Lampe durchs Zimmer wie Tarzan
Ich bin der vor dem sie dich immer gewarnt haben

[Hook]
Ich bin all das wovor deine Eltern
Dich immer gewarnt haben
Doch ich hab Geld, hab Frauen, hab Spaß
Und du musst immer noch Bahn fahren
Ich bin ein schlechtes Vorbild
Na und wer sagt was schlecht ist?
Ich passe nicht in dein Konzept
Egal mir geht es prächtig
Pass gut auf, hör mir zu, mach's mir nach
(Mach's mir nach du Spinner!)
Ich bleib so wie ich bin egal was ihr sagt


[Part 3]
Ich scheiß' ne Wurst drauf
Wenn euer Kind versucht wie ich zu sein, dann lasst es machen
Man lernt nicht, dass Feuer heiß ist ohne es mal anzufassen
Woher wollt ihr wissen was gut ist, wenn nichts schlecht ist?
Wenn nichts schön ist, bin ich auch nicht hässlich
Seid doch ehrlich, ihr wart doch auch mal jung
Und habt gekifft oder woher kommen die Raucherlungen
Tut nicht so als wenn ihr Engel wart. Ihr habt Leichen im Keller
Wie jeder andere, also seid leise ihr Penner
Vertraut euer'm Kind, ihr werdet nicht enttäuscht
Meine Mutter hat das auch geschafft und sie hat es nicht bereut
Du musst einfach das Kind in dir rauslassen
Bis deine Kinder auf ihre Kinder aufpassen

[Hook]
Ich bin all das wovor deine Eltern
Dich immer gewarnt haben
Doch ich hab Geld, hab Frauen, hab Spaß
Und du musst immer noch Bahn fahren
Ich bin ein schlechtes Vorbild
Na und wer sagt was schlecht ist?
Ich passe nicht in dein Konzept
Egal mir geht es prächtig
Pass gut auf, hör mir zu, mach's mir nach
(Mach's mir nach du Spinner!)
Ich bleib so wie ich bin egal was ihr sagt
[Intro]
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!

[Strophe 1]
Ich komme aus Böblingen bei Stuttgart (uncool!)
Jetzt wohn ich in Berlin seit 18 Monaten und ich muss sagen ich bin echt angekomm'n (aha)
Meine Kleidung unterstreicht meinen Charakter
Meine Brille ist nicht vintage, verdammt die ist retro!
Undercut und Jutebeutel
Ich trink die Club Mate oder gibt's den Caffè Latte auch mit Sojamilch? (I like)
Die große Frage: Schreibt mich irgendjemand auf die Gästeliste?
(Äh, naja...) - Bitte, bitte, bitte!

[Refrain: Kraftklub]
Doch auch wenn andere Städte scheiße sind
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Und ich damit komplett alleine bin
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Auch wenn dort alle meine Freunde sind
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Will ich nicht nach Berlin!
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Doch auch wenn andere Städte scheiße sind
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Und ich damit komplett alleine bin
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Auch wenn dort alle meine Freunde sind
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Will ich nicht nach Berlin!
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!


[Strophe 2]
Ich hab da gerade so'n Projekt (super!)
Noch nichts Konkretes aber sehr geil
Business-mäßig hab ich mich da noch nicht festgelegt
Irgendwas im Creative-Bereich (auf jeden Fall)
Bloß kein 9 to 5 Job (no go) find ich ja mega-ätzend
Genau, ich mach einfach einen Fashion-Blog (geil)
Und laufe dann mit meiner Spiegelreflex durch Friedrichshain und mache Fotos
Von Streetart und interessanten Leuten
Hauptsache hier in Berlin

[Refrain: Kraftklub]
Doch auch wenn andere Städte scheiße sind
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Und ich damit komplett alleine bin
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Auch wenn dort alle meine Freunde sind
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Will ich nicht nach Berlin!
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Doch auch wenn andere Städte scheiße sind
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Und ich damit komplett alleine bin
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Auch wenn dort alle meine Freunde sind
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!
Will ich nicht nach Berlin!
Ich will nicht nach Berlin!


[Outro]
Aa-aah, ich will nicht nach Berlin
Aa-aah, ich will nicht nach Berlin
Aa-aah, ich will nicht nach Berlin
Aa-aah, ich will nicht nach Berlin
Aa-aah, ich will nicht nach Berlin
Aa-aah, ich will nicht nach Berlin
Kasanatte'ta mune no oto
Yusabutte mo kikoenai
Koboreochita PIISU

Konna nichijou no yuuutsu sae
Tameiki mo dezu ni mukanjou na bokura

Life filled with vanity
Colors have faded
Things you desire exist here
Flee from this colorless world

Tsugihagi no kokoro wa fuantei
Arainagasareta shoki shoudou o yobisamashite hashiridase
Mazui kotoba omou mama ni tsunagu yo ano hi no kodou
Wasurenaide

Oh my lord, it's gone!!
What shall I do?
Pieces I had have fell apart
Where do you belong?
Where should I aim for?
Once you've lost sight it's left to fall apart

Let's start it over again
Rebuild and combine all the pieces we have lost
To become one like a puzzle
Take it one at a time


When I stopped a rusted chain tangled me up
Tying my body onto the ground
As I sink underground I call your name
What can I do to see the day light once more?

Tear it apart and rip it off
Break the chain now
Sink down or swim up
Fight your way through
Seek your way out
If you can not, you are left to drown deep inside
Chain tangled me harder, choking my neck

Tsuyogatte'ta boku no koto
Mimamotte'ta kimi wa iu
Ima koko ni iru yo

Itsu made mo kienai omoi o
Tsunagitomerareta shoki shoudou o
Yobisamashite hashiridase
Ano hi no kodou wa
Boku to kimi no naka no uchuu de hibiite iru yo

Misery is nothing
It is all up to your thoughts
And beliefs to bring in success within your life


Don't you compare yourself with other people
That's a waste of person you are so why not be honest to your emotion
Wasurenaide

All the promises made between us
Broke in pieces and turned into sand
Let's escape from this colorless world to find myself
And tomorrow that we live
[Intro: beabadoobee]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee &amp; Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)


[Verse 2: Powfu]
I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee &amp; Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Outro: beabadoobee]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Baby yeah, you worth it

[Chorus]
Cotton candy skies
Why can’t you be mine
Always on my mind
I’m running out of time
Skies aren’t always blue
When I think of you
I’m tryna' make it through
I caught you like the flu

[Verse 1]
With my outstretched hands
Wish I had a chance
Life's just not too fair
I'm stuck in this chair
You're like the moon
I'm chasing after you
Are you just a phase
I pray its not this way

[Chorus]
Cotton candy skies
Why can’t you be mine
Always on my mind
I’m running out of time
Skies aren’t always blue
When I think of you
I’m tryna' make it through
I caught you like the flu


[Chorus]
Cotton candy skies
Why can’t you be mine
Always on my mind
I’m running out of time
Skies aren’t always blue
When I think of you
I’m tryna' make it through
I caught you like the flu

[Verse 2]
Told you how I feel
Were you even real
Miss you so dam much
I'm banking on my luck
Breathing in and out
Why can't I see straight
My mind switching lanes
I'm trapped in my own brain
[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be callin'
None of that could ever make me leave

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I look into your eyes, I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside, I feel it

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

[Verse 2: Daniel Caesar]
And when we're making love, uh
Your cries, they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need between those thighs

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Every time I look into your eyes, I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside, I feel it


[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah babe
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

[Verse 3: Kali Uchis]
And I’ll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it’s all just memories
Now

[Bridge: Daniel Caesar]
(If you've got someone you like)
Don't you love when I come around
(Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like)
Don't you love when I come around
(Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take—

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah babe
Oooooooh, who would've thought I'd get you?


[Outro: Kali Uchis]
This feels like summer
Boy, you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy, you'll lead me to paradise
[Verse]
Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just tryna chill and make bangers" (Bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (Yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (Facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (Hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (Say it)
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (Huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (Skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (Facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (Huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (No)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (Cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced (Laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (Fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (Fucked up shit)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this (Woo)
I walked into the label, "Where the check at?" ("Where the check?")
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (Bad ass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (Try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound (Blap!)


[Chorus]
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch (woo)

[Bridge]
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (yeah)
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (ah)
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me (grrr)
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy (grrr)

[Chorus]
We gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten (woo)
Yeah, I said we gon' win

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish &amp; Khalid]
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

[Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

[Verse 2: Khalid with Billie Eilish]
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish &amp; Khalid]
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near

[Part 1]
Du hast ihn kennengelernt und warst so aufgeregt
Am nächsten Tag hast du's gleich all deinen Freundinnen erzählt
Er ist voll nett und so, meldet sich jeden Tag
Er ist voll anders als die andern nicht so ein Mega-Arsch

[Pre-hook]
Ja und du denkst echt
Du könntest seine Freundin sein
Doch er weiß genau
Ja wer ficken will muss Freundlich sein

[Hook]
Denn Frauen täuschen nen Orgasmus vor, Männer die Liebe
Und wenn du sagst das stimmt so nicht dann kennst du noch nicht viele
Männer lächeln dich so süß an und sie tun immer so nett
Doch das einzige dass die wolln das bist du und zwar nackt in ihrem Bett
Ah nackt in ihrem Bett
Ah und dann schicken sie dich weg

[Bridge]
(Gesprochen) du weißt du was?
Ich glaub das soll einfach mit uns beiden nich sein
Aber ah ich muss jetzt auch dringend weg

[Part 2]
Und jetzt heulst du wieder die ganze nacht
Ey was hast du dir da nur schon wieder angelacht?
Du denkst nen besseren typen kannst du nicht finden
Der ist bestimmt gar nicht so der hat nur angst sich zu binden


[Pre-hook]
Ja und du denkst echt, du könntest seine Freundin sein
Doch er weiß genau: Ja wer ficken will muss Freundlich sein

[Hook]
Denn Frauen täuschen nen Orgasmus vor, Männer die Liebe
Und wenn du sagst das stimmt so nicht dann kennst du noch nicht viele
Männer lächeln dich so süß an und sie tun immer so nett
Doch das einzige dass die woll'n das bist du und zwar nackt in ihrem bett
Ah nackt in ihrem Bett
Ah und dann schicken sie dich weg

[Bridge]
He ich mein das ist mir jetzt auch unangenehm
Und es tut mir auch 'n bisschen leid aber es ist halt kompliziert
Ich mein Frauen, die wollen liebe
Und Sicherheit
Und kinder
Viele kinder
Und Zuneigung
Und Aufmerksamkeit
Und 'n offenes Ohr
Und 'n Superhelden
Und das am besten alles in einer Person und zeitgleich
So und wir Männer, ich mein wir wollen doch einfach nur
Ficken
Und 'n bisschen Geschlechtsverkehr
Und 'n bisschen ab und zu mal Sex
Und wenn du zeitgleich mit uns vögeln könntest, wär's super


[Hook]
Denn Frauen täuschen nen Orgasmus vor, Männer die Liebe
Und wenn du sagst das stimmt so nicht dann kennst du noch nicht viele
Männer lächeln dich so süß an und sie tun immer so nett
Doch das einzige dass die woll'n das bist du und zwar nackt in ihrem Bett
Ah nackt in ihrem bett
Ah und dann schicken sie dich weg
[Intro:]
Der Abschied hält nicht ewig, Baby, sorg dich nicht
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor Gericht
3,4

[Part 1:]
Komm doch her, Einzelkampf, Sei ein Mann
Aber leb mit dem Konter: Ich zeig dich an!
31er-Style: Hab ich ein schlechten Tag
Wird jeder, der mir in die Quere kommt wegverklagt
Ich bin Sportsmann, doch wenn du mich beim Handball toppst
Kriegst du ganz salopp von meinem Anwalt Post
Ist es kälter als in den Wetterberichten
Komm ich mit rechtlichen Schritten
Es ist ok, babe, dass dich der Zeitungsjunge fickt
Wenn ich bei den Bullen snitch steht es Eins zu Null für mich
Ob ich dich je geliebt hab, fragst du mich
Tja, ohne meinen Anwalt sag ich nichts

[Hook:]
Der Abschied hält nicht ewig, Baby, sorg dich nicht
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor Gericht
Gewalt ist zum Zerstören nicht erforderlich
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor Gericht


[Part 2:]
Schon in der Schule ließ ich mich lächelnd verdreschen
Um danach in aller Ruhe beim Direktor zu petzen
Ich hab schon damals begriffen: Ich kann mit staatlichen Mitteln
Rivalen vernichten – wie bei Indianergeschichten
Meine Eltern sagten: Ich soll nicht mit Pornoheften spielen
Ich verklagte sie und ließ ihnen das Sorgerecht entziehen
Wenn es ein Wortgefecht mit meinem Vorgesetzten gibt
Beginnt sofort ein Zettelkrieg
Ich hab' Benzin getrunken und auf die Straße gekackt
Die Tankstelle zahlt mir heute Schadensersatz - was?
Wo sind unsere Kinder, fragst du mich
Du weißt: ohne meinen Anwalt sag' ich nichts!

[Hook:]
Der Abschied hält nicht ewig, Baby, sorg dich nicht
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor Gericht
Gewalt ist zum Zerstören nicht erforderlich
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor Gericht

[Part 3:]
(Achtung, Achtung, Die Sicherheitskräfte haben die Kontrolle verloren)
Ich wollte grad n' Raubkopierer für die Todesstrafe zwangsmelden
Doch erreichte keinen von meinen hochbezahlten Anwälten
Die Stadt sieht komisch aus, da les' ich aufm Flugblattzettel
Das System ist kollabiert – Es gibt nur noch Naturgesetze
Mist! Jetzt tun sich die Nachbarn zusammen
Jetzt muss ich leben mit Menschen die ich nicht abmahnen kann
In der Gruppe überleb ich immerhin
Ob ich Empathie habe? – Ne, ich bin geimpft
Was? Ja, ich war der, der euch verurteilte
Guckt doch nicht so furchteinflößend – schöne Wurfpfeile!
Kommt schon, ich hab die Regeln nicht gemacht
Nur ausgelegt wie es mir passt ohne den Nächstenlieben-Quatsch
Habt Erbarmen!
Ich kann mich nicht prügeln oder Messer zücken
Ich kenne als Versteck zum Flüchten nur Gesetzeslücken
Der nasse Fleck in mein'm Schritt
Zeigt: Ohne meinen Anwalt bin ich nix!


[Hook:]
Der Abschied hält nicht ewig, Baby, sorg dich nicht
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor Gericht
Gewalt ist zum Zerstören nicht erforderlich
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor Gericht

[Outro]
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor
Wir sehn uns vor, wir sehn uns vor Gericht
[Geflüstert] (15x)
Schüttel deinen Speck

[Part 1]
Yep yep, ich lass mich heut Abend blicken
Ich komm gut geschmückt in den Laden geritten
Alle tanzen, die Damen sind echt entzückend
N ganzes Backblech voller Sahneschnitten
Die Torten sch-schütteln ihre Schrippen
Sch-schütteln ihr Gold aufn Rippen
Sch-sch-schütteln ihr Holz vor den Hütten
Die Macker versuchen im Takt zu nicken
Hey Barmann mix mir was zusamm'
Er schüttelt es, schüttet ein bis zum Rand
Ein Riesenhit drückt mich an die Wand
Der DJ swippt ich schüttel ihm die Hand
Vielen Dank! es bebt und wankt
Alle drehn sich um, sehn sie an
Sie ist zwei Tonnen pure Eleganz
Sie tanzt mit mir wie 'n schöner Elefant

[Hook]
Mama! Zeig mir dein Gepäck!
Baby! Komm, schüttel Bug und Heck!
Perle! Dein Tisch ist gut gedeckt
Schüttel deinen Speck, ah, schüttel deinen Speck, ah


[Part 2]
Ja, dein Tisch ist fein gedeckt
Uuuh, ich brauch kein Besteck
Lecker! Du musst mich beißen lassen
Ich bin Bäcker und back auf deinen heißen Backen
Dein Großhaar wackelt auf und ab
Dein Obst ist knackig frisch verpackt
Feinste Trüffel, groß und kompakt
Du schüttelst mich nich ab!
Ich häng mich an dein wippenden Rock
Ich häng an deinen Lippen wie Gloss
Du bist schön und schlau, ich studier Barock
Bitte werd meine Frau! Du schüttelst den Kopf
Ich schütte mich zu, denn das ist hart für mich
Kipp ausn Schuhen, Sanitäter tragen mich
Ich krieg Schüttelfrost, du bist der Arzt für mich
Gib mir n Mittel, bitte schüttel dein Arsch für mich!

[Geflüstert] (24x)
Schüttel deinen Speck
Schüttel deinen Speck
[Intro]
Hey, leave a message

[Verse 1]
Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked

[Pre-Chorus]
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor


[Verse 2]
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad

[Chorus]
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
Don'tcha, babe?
I'm not your party favor
[Intro: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Get on your knees and bow down

[Verse 1: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Yeah, I come alive, I'll survive, take on anything
So paint a target on my back, let 'em come for me
I don't fall, don't quit, don't ever sleep
'Cause I'm on another level that you'll never reach
If you seek forgiveness
You'll get nothing, you'll get nothing from me

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser &amp; Eric Vanlerberghe]
You will never know, it's the price I pay
Look into my eyes, we are not the same
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
'Cause I'm in control, and you'll know my name
'Cause I gave my life, gave it everything
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and bow down
Get on your knees and bow down

[Post-Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
You better recognize


[Verse 2: Eric Vanlerberghe]
You wanna talk that shit, time to back it up
'Cause the best of your best ain't good enough
Playing with my name, now I know you really fucked up
Keep running your mouth, and I'ma call your bluff

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser &amp; Eric Vanlerberghe]
You will never know, it's the price I pay
Look into my eyes, we are not the same
Yeah, this is where you fall apart (Fall apart)
Yeah, this is where you break
'Cause I'm in control, and you'll know my name
'Cause I gave my life, gave it everything
Yeah, this is where you fall apart (Fall apart)
Yeah, this is where you break (Where you break)
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and

[Post-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser]
You're never gonna be enough

[Bridge: Brian Burkheiser]
So I had this dream, it meant everything, and I watched it come alive
Then I let you in, underneath my skin, and I learned to love the lies
Now I lay awake, and I contemplate, have I become what I hate?
Can I take it back? 'Cause it's all I have, will it get the best of me?


[Breakdown: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Have you ever had a dream? Would you fight for it?
Would you go to war? Would you die for it?
So now I'll take my stand, now I'll make you see
That if you seek forgiveness, you'll get nothing from me
You'll get nothing from me
You'll get nothing from me
You'll get nothing from me

[Outro: Brian Burkheiser &amp; Eric Vanlerberghe]
To everybody who doubted, to everybody who doubted
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and bow down, bow down, bow down
[Verse 1]
Hum tere bin ab reh nahi sakte
Tere bina kya wajood mera
Hum tere bin ab reh nahi sakte
Tere bina kya wajood mera
Tujhse juda gar ho jaayenge
Toh khud se hi ho jaayenge judaa

[Chorus]
Kyun ki tum hi ho
Ab tum hi ho
Zindagi ab tum hi ho
Chain bhi, mera dard bhi
Meri aashiqui ab tum hi ho

[Verse 2]
Tera mera rishta hai kaisa
Ik pal door gawara nahi
Tere liye har roz hai jeete
Tujh ko diya mera waqt sabhi
Koi lamha mera na ho tere bina
Har saans pe naam tera

[Chorus]
Kyun ki tum hi ho
Ab tum hi ho
Zindagi ab tum hi ho
Chain bhi, mera dard bhi
Meri aashiqui ab tum hi ho


[Verse 3]
Tere liye hi jiya main
Khudko jo yun de diya hai
Tere wafa ne mujhko sambhala;
Saare ghamon ko dil se nikala
Tere saath mera hai naseeb juda
Tujhe paake addhura na raha

[Chorus]
Kyun ki tum hi ho
Ab tum hi ho
Zindagi ab tum hi ho
Chain bhi, mera dard bhi
Meri aashiqui ab tum hi ho
[Introduction]
Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown
And things seem hard or tough
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft
And you feel that you've had quite enough....

[Verse 1]
Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour
That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
A sun that is the source of all our power
The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
Are moving at a million miles a day
In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour
Of the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way'

[Verse 2]
Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars.
It's a hundred thousand light years side to side
It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick
But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide
We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point
We go 'round every two hundred million years
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe


[Verse 3]
The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
In all of the directions it can whizz
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know
Twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure
How amazingly unlikely is your birth
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
'Cause there's bugger-all down here on Earth!
Manga no shujinkō no aitsu wa itta

Without making one unpleasant face, smiling, crying in the shadows

Tatakatta sukutta

Tada asa matteta nani mo sezu boku wa hitori beddo no ue de
I just waited for the morning without doing anything, alone on my bed

While watching the same old news again in front of the television

Mata itsumo no heiwa o matte ita nda

Kimi datte onaji datte dare datte matteru tte
Even you, it's the same, everybody, is waiting


Boku datte sore ga nani ka wakaranaikara utatte ndaro
I'm singing probably because even I don't know what that is

Atarimaeda to omotteta ashita ga kuru koto mo akite ita
I’ve grown tired of each day I thought of as ordinary that comes

Mendōna koto kiraidatta shinpurude yokatta
I hated things that took care, simplicity was best

Demo nazeka heya ni aru gitā dake wa
But for some reason the guitar in my room

Sute rarenakatta
Was the only thing I couldn’t throw away

Sukoshi dake  sukoshi dake  sukoshi dake  sukoshi dake
Just a little, just a little, just a little, just a little

1-Jō demo ibasho ga hoshikatta

Boku dake ga boku dake ga boku dake ga boku dake ga
Only me, only me, only me, only me

I wanted to be someone's number one

‘Cause I'm me, ‘Cause I'm me, ‘Cause I'm me, this is how I am but

Ai shite okureyo
Love me

Yurushite okureyo
Forgive me
[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—


[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—


[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—


[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?

[Verse 1]
Just an urchin living under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time, take it to the end of the line
Rags and riches, or so they say, you gotta
Keep pushing for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime, everybody's doing the time

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home


[Verse 2]
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The Surgeon General say's it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette
But I can't see, tell me who you're gonna believe

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, oh yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
So far–away
So far–away
So far–away
So far–away

[Verse 3]
Captain America's been torn apart, now
He's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start"
I must be losing my mind, are you blind? I've seen it all a million times


[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, oh yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, home

[Outro]
I wanna go, I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see, how good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down (oh yeah), spin me 'round
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see, how good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see, how good it can be
Oh, take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna go, I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Baby
[Verse 1: Lollia]
You try to run me through
Hold on, think again
Don't you know what you're starting?
No... you sure ain't got a clue
How bad this will go
Don't you know, know my art
(Art of war)
And as you look to the horizon, not a cloud
But the stormy weathers’ caught you cold
Seems like it crept up out of nowhere all around
Though it’s not quite what you foretold

[Chorus 1: Lollia]
You'll never see it coming
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
You're done in by the time it's hit you
Your last surprise

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2: AmaLee]
You think you got your game
Planned out to a T
Yet I'm two steps ahead yeah
So... you step into my way
Stand down it's a trap
One more step and you're dead
(Yeah you're dead)
Why just a picosecond ago
Clear blue skies
But now lightning's struck your last resolve
It's not an accident that no one hears your cries
As your last strength seems to dissolve


[Chorus 1: AmaLee]
You'll never see it coming
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
You're done in by the time it's hit you, your last surprise

[Chorus 2: AmaLee]
I'm coming for you
My game's always so fast, so fine
You're spun in
By the net you didn't catch it in time

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[Bridge: Lollia and AmaLee]
Better think about your game
Are you sure your next move is the right one for you?

Are you sure you won't get outmaneuvered
Again and again my friend?

[Chorus 1: Lollia]
You'll never see it coming
You'll see that my mind is too fast for eyes
You're done in
By the time it's hit you, your last surprise


[Chorus 2: AmaLee]
I'm coming for you
My game's always so fast, so fine
You're spun in
By the net you didn't catch it in time

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

(Let me see you go)
सन १९८८, नवम्बर, १६
किसी को थी ना ख़बर ज़रा सी
के आया दुनिया में एक कलाकार
जो बनेगा star, देसी Hip-Hop की ज़ुबानी
ये ज़लज़ला तूफ़ानी, जो लब्ज़ों में सुनामी
जो लड़ गया ज़माने से, बन गया कहानी (Oah!)
हुआ सब कुछ जैसा मैंने सोचा
आधी मेहनत, आधी रहमत थी खुदा की
पाँव रहते ज़मीं पर
पर मेरी आँखें आसमाँ पे की करूँ उसे हासिल
सुना सबको, बनाया पर खुदका
सीखा नही था रुकना, तभी बना मैं काबिल
पागल हुआ जब सुना मैंने rap
किसी दोस्त की वजह से
आज उसे मेरा thank you
बना ज़रिया, कमाया भरा पेट मैंने
लोगों की पसंद में भी हुआ फिर शामिल
"क़ातिल" बुलाते मुझे यार मेरे
करा नही rap मैंने कभी बनने के लिए cool
यार-दोस्त आज भी वही जो थे दुसरी में साथ मेरे
जब Sachdeva था school
Gucci, Versace, Prada ज़रा सब पर
कभी-कभी पहनूँ मैं shirt २०० वाली
ताकी अपनी औकात और उस शुरुआत को
ग़लती से जाऊँ ना मैं भूल


[Chorus]
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे चल"
मैं आगे चलता चला गया
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे बढ़"
मैं आगे बढ़ता चला गया
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे चल"
मैं आगे चलता चला गया
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे बढ़"
मैं आगे बढ़ता चला गया

(आगे बढ़...)
(आगे-आगे बढ़...)

[Verse 2]
बड़े सपने देखे रात-दिन जो
ऐसी औलाद मिली मेरे माँ-बाप को
पेट काटा अपना दिया जो था बस का
पूरा किया मेरे हर छोटे-मोटे ख्वाब को
आज तो हैं खुश कहते है "कुछ कर गया"
कैसे मैं चुकाऊँ अब उनके हिसाब को?
मिली जन्नत मुझे मरे बिना धरती पे
बेटा नही पाला, पाला एक सैलाब को
चलो बंद करता हूँ ऐसी बातें
मैंने हवा में फैला दी थोड़ी seriousness
ऐसे गाने ही करूँगा promote
खर्चूंगा यही note, चाहे views आए less
हाँ, yes, यहाँ गंध ज़्यादा बिकता है
झूठ यहाँ hit है, सच नही दिखता है
कौन hit कितना है? कैसा है? किसी को समझ नही
सबको ही वैसा ही दिखना है, जिनका है
कुछ ऐसा ही plan करो जान के
मैं सब काम नकली हूँ जड़ से मिटाने वाला
कहते हैं मुझे rap करो slow ये लो
अगली बार मैं धीरे नही गाने वाला
करूँ मन की, लो photo मेरे तन की
मुझसे ज़्यादा सनकी नही है तेरा star
वो sky high, मैं अंतरिक्ष पार
सियाही दे गवाही Kalamkaar Raftaar (Raa!)


[Chorus]
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे चल"
मैं आगे चलता चला गया
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे बढ़"
मैं आगे बढ़ता चला गया
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे चल"
मैं आगे चलता चला गया
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे बढ़"
मैं आगे बढ़ता चला गया

[Post-Chorus]
(You can't stop me)
कलम ही धरम है करनी शरम ना
जख़म-जख़म लगते मरहम ना
सकन लगन दुखती तपन ना
सगन-सगन बढ़ती रकम आ
कलम ही धरम है करनी शरम ना
जख़म-जख़म लगते मरहम ना
सकन लगन दुखती तपन ना
सगन-सगन बढ़ती रकम आ

[Outro]
वो बोले मुझे, "थोड़ा आगे चल"
Gall goriye
Gali gali hundi teri

Mr. Buttar
Raftaar…
Baby love!

Tu kinni sohni lagdi ae
Paa ainaka kaaliyan kaaliyan…

Tu kinni sohni lagdi ae
Paa ainaka kaaliyan kaaliyan
Tere piche ghumdiyan ne
Car’an do chitta waaliyan…

Gali gali hundi teri gall goriye
Thoda jeha hisaab naal chal gori..
Gali gali hundi teri gall goriye
Thoda jeha hisaab naal chal goriye

Tere karke jawakan ne
Kanna vich mundran paa li aan…

Tu kinni sohni lagdi ae
Paa ainaka kaaliyan kaaliyan
Tere piche ghumdiyan ne
Car’an do chitta waaliyan..



Yeh jo ruk rahe hain
Woh fukre hain
Hum aashiq hain tabhi jhuk rahe hain
RAA!
Teri taarifon ke toh pul baandh doon
Par tujhe pehle apne baare mein gyaan doon
Jaan dete honge dooje
Par mujhe toh saath jeena tere hai
Main kyon jaan doon
Meri baby hai lady
Nahi koi samaan
Mujhe dikkat unse
Jinki gandi zubaan
Unko farak nahi
Kya ghalat kya sahi
Yeh bache kaise saath denge tera meri jaan
Tujhe plane chahiye
Bas man nahi Superman chahiye
Aira gera nahi Gentleman chahiye
Tu woh nahi jisko ki brand chahiye
Ya night stand chahiye
I know…
Tujhe kaise karna hai treat
Tujhe dinner le jaana piche karke teri seat
Teri yehi hai umeed main na karun cheat
Don’t worry!
Main number saare kar chuka delete


Gall goriye…
Gali gali…

Kam kaar yaara de chhuda ka rakhte
Neendan veendan aundiya si sab kho layi aan
Tere naal ikk photo lain de layi
Ghar agge tere chaldiyan goliyan (x2)

Tere karke Jaani ni
Daddy do khanda gaaliyan…

Tu kinni sohni lagdi ae
Paa ainaka kaaliyan kaaliyan
Tere piche ghumdiyan ne
Car’an do chitta waaliyan (x2)

Gall goriye..
Gali gali..

Unh huh! Mr. Buttar!
Raftaar!
Baby love!

Raftaar ! Brodha V !

[Verse 1: Raftaar]
Jo Main Aaj Likhta Hu Wo Kal Bikta Hai
Main Aaj Karta Hu Wo Kal Dikhta Hai
Main Beej Seechta Hu Tabhi Fal Milta Hai
Jo Mehnat Kare Aaj Wahi Kal Tikta Hai
Mere Khoon Mein Behti Siyahi
Mere Nabzon Mein Basti Likhai
Mere Dil Se Kalam Pe Jo Utar Ke Aayi
Mere Hathon Ne Meri Aankho Ko Duniya Dikhayi
(Aan), Mera Flow Laye Show
(Aan), Mera Flow Laye Dough
(Aan), Mera Flow Aaye To
Mera Bhai Bole Baakiyon Ka Ho Pare Ho
Mera Flow Jump Man Jaise Jordan
Dhyaan Rakhu Sabka Main Jaise Koi Warden
Kabhi Karu Boarding Flight India Mein Kabhi Foreign
Man Kare Fly Wo Bhi Free Jaise Morgan
Punchline Subliminal
Cynically Sane Par Lyrically Criminal
Verbally Physical Style Nahi Typical
Mera Gaane Samjhna Inko Lagta Kaafi Difficult
Waise Gaano Pe Ho Jaate Sau Mill
Aise Gaano Pe Hona Hai Mushqil
Main Hu Goku Kisse Bhidayega
Beta Khamakha Mein Tu Kame-Hame-Ha Khayega


[Chorus] (x2)
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai

[Verse 2: Brodha V and RaftaaR]
Put In The Effort And I Waited So Long
Waking Up Everyday, Motivated To Rake Up A Storm
Invade The Nation With The Bars That Be Made Of Napalms
But All I Ever Hear Is They Ain’t Gon Be Playing My Songs
On TV, I’m Sitting Here Wondering Why
These Heads Of Programming Just Stutter And Hide
(Na, Inhe Kuchh Bhi Na Samajh Aaye
Brodha V Mere Bhai Karo Hindi Try)
Okay…!
Kaafi Time Ho Gaya Hai Mujhe Aaye
Par TV Walo Ne Mere Gaane Nahi Chalaye
Meri Baate Inhe Samajh Na Aaye
Mere Rap Inke Liye Paheliya Hai Bhai
Yeh Naachenge Aise Hi Beat Pe
Yeh Chorus Gayenge Repeat Pe
Jinhone Kabhi Khud Na Music Banaya
Yeh Saare Ke Saare They Trying To Teach Me
(Haan!) Slow Mera Career
Yahan Kaafi Zyada Language Barrier
Hindi Mein Mera Hath Thoda Tight
Warna Pehle Hi Hota Main Bombay Ki Flight Mein
Baate Jitni Sach Utna Paisa Kam
Gaana Utna Hit Jitni Dham Dham
Kaam Wale Bole Deal Karo Lump Sum
Beat Aur Rap Ka Dono Ka Rakam Kam?


[Chorus] (x2)
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai

They Just Wanna Dance Now
(Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai, Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai)
They Just Wanna Dance Now…
(Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai, Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai)
They Just Wanna Dance Now…
(Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai, Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai)
They Just Wanna Dance Now…
(Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai, Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai)

[Outro: Raftaar]
Yeh Naachte Naachte Jhool Gaye
Jaane Yeh Kitna School Gaye
Disco Mein Gaanon Pe Thumke Laga Ke
Yeh Jeene Ka Maqsad Hi Bhool Gaye..(x2)
The Thing Goes Skkrrrrraaa
Main Rap Karun Tha Tha Tha!
Jo Rapper Hai Whack
Unhe Sunte Ho Aap Aap Aap!
Skidi pap Phum Phum
Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang Kam Sun!
Jaldi Se Aankhein Kholo
Jinke Hosh Hai Gum Gum Gum!


[Chorus] (x2)
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Inhe Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai
Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai

They Just Wanna Dance Now…
(Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai, Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai)
They Just Wanna Dance Now…
(Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai, Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai)
They Just Wanna Dance Now…
(Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai, Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai)
They Just Wanna Dance Now…
(Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai, Bas Naachne Ka Shaunq Hai)

[Bridge: Raftaar]
Ghar pe lambi gadhi, ghar me bakse me he rolly
Rehta aapni trip me, par me khata nahi molly
Studio hey ghar me, office 200 meter dur
Boli meri meethi, par me haato se majdur
Na-na (Na-na), meri aagne na zor chala
Na-na (Na-na), Le le ye free ki salla
Ha-ha (Ha-ha), maa ne to meri kaha
Ha-ha, sab tu bhula ke ja dushma ko gale laga


[Outro]
Being an artist, being me
That was my best excuse for being crazy
[Chorus: Thundamentals, Hilltop Hoods &amp; Mataya]
Did you ever believe, yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me, no-oh
Got nothing to lose but 21 grams, uh-huh
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), don’t fuck with your man (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams (Ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), send love to your fam (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams
It ain’t but 21 grams, ain’t but 21 grams
Just 21 grams

[Verse 1: Pressure]
Cheah
One life here to foster, no time here to squander
Grew wiser and stronger, yet still tryna conjure a little ray of sunshine in a Quagmire
For the prize on offer, we divide and we conquer
If I fight any longer I’ma start looking like all my rivals and in time will give rise to a monster
Gotta be more to life than sort of like every morning rise and shine
I wanna see all the lights on tour life then immortalised in time
What’s the weight of a human soul? Does it change if bruised or old?
Famine or fame, man, it’s all the same, that’s what you stand to gain vs. lose it all

[Verse 2: Jeswon]
All that glitters ain't gold, what's royal is loyalty shown to your fam
What’s the weight of your soul? They say it nuttin' but 21 grams
Slow dance with the devil, he asked for my signature written in blood
I won’t bow to that level, know I can do better in death, hope my spirits arisen above
But, yo, will I be judged on the good and the bad that I've done in my life?
When I'm writing these songs, I'm righting my wrongs, that’s how it feels with each word I recite
Like I’m earning the right to be making amends, apologies given to all of my friends
If ever I dissed you know that I didn’t mean to offend


[Chorus: Thundamentals, Hilltop Hoods &amp; Mataya]
Did you ever believe, yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me, no-oh
Got nothing to lose but 21 grams, uh-huh
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), don’t fuck with your man (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams (Ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), send love to your fam (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams
It ain’t but 21 grams, ain’t but 21 grams
Just 21 grams

[Verse 3: Tuka]
And I
Can’t help but feel a little blessed like yes, I’ma do it better than the best I can
I’ma get it in with whatever I have like damn by chance
Do you wanna take my hand? Do you wanna dance in the middle of the street like me?
Side step it to the left of the centre ‘cause I’ve never been a fan of that right wing bullshit and negativity
Check it, I don’t mean to preach, this is not an anthem, Tuka’s on a rant let me pen a bit of peace, fuck a hand gun
If your head’s buried in the sand then understand I’m just tryna get a bit of free in me
Get a bit of free in me, dive deep, sightseeing the earth on cloud nine
Dreaming free as a bird, try to focus when the scenery blurs

[Verse 4: Suffa]
Bringing life into this world's like bringing a grain of sand to the beach, but
Thing is that this little girl's like ten point five grams of you and me, love
Everythin’ from our past is passed on, it survived, it’s alive in our daughter
You ever think there's a link when we pass on? She might have passed on five and a quarter
Immortalised, I thought that I had everything I wanted
It all was lies, there's more to life, couldn't put my finger on it
My daughter’s eyes, I see my parents, see your parents too
Apparent when you stare into her eyes and she got a pair like you


[Chorus: Thundamentals, Hilltop Hoods &amp; Mataya]
Did you ever believe, yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me, no-oh
Got nothing to lose but 21 grams, uh-huh
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), don’t fuck with your man (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams (Ah-hoo)
Just let it all go (Oh-ho), send love to your fam (Ah-ha)
When the weight of a soul (Yeah-hair) just 21 grams
It ain’t but 21 grams, ain’t but 21 grams
Just 21 grams

[Outro: Thundamentals, Hilltop Hoods &amp; Mataya]
Just 21 grams
Did you ever believe, yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Try take it from me, no-oh
Got nothing to lose but 21 grams
[Intro]
Yeah, थोड़ा move, baby
Raftaar

[Verse 1]
हाय, मेरा सर तू घुमाए, aye
मेरे सीने में सुईयाँ चुभाए, aye
मुझे पीएँ बिना चढ़ा है सुरूर
तेरी आँखें इस बंदे को नशे में डूबाए, aye
मुझको तू मुझसे चुरा ले ज़रा (हाय)
पास तू मुझको बुला ले ज़रा
दिल रहता है सारा दिन भरा-भरा
सब तेरी ग़लती है, सब तेरा करा-धरा
ये हाथ नी आएगी, ये साथ नी जाएगी
पर बात करूँ, baby, मैं तो साथ निभाने की

[Chorus]
जैसी move तू करती है, लगता है जान से मारेगी
या तू प्यार से मारेगी, या रफ़्तार से मारेगी
जैसी move तू करती है, लगता है जान से मारेगी
या तू प्यार से मारेगी, या रफ़्तार से मारेगी

[Bridge]
ये रुकने नी वाली
(Move) ये रुकने नी, रुकने नी
(Move) ये रुकने नी वाली
(Move)


[Verse 2]
ये रुकने नी वाली, कसम है खा ली
घूमे जैसे body की फ़िरकी बना ली
सब हुए लट्टू, रुकना ना अब तू
तेरे लिए beat बजे, तेरे लिए ताली
बदन लचीला, baby, rubber band है
Bend down करे, दोनों घुटनों पे hand है
तुझे सजने की ना है ज़रूरत
पहने तू १०० की भी चीज़ तो brand है

[Chorus]
जैसी move तू करती है, लगता है जान से मारेगी
या तू प्यार से मारेगी, या रफ़्तार से मारेगी
जैसी move तू करती है, लगता है जान से मारेगी
या तू प्यार से मारेगी, या रफ़्तार से मारेगी

[Outro]
Everybody go
Move तू करती
(Move) move तू करती
(Move) move तू करती
(Move) रफ़्तार से मारेगी
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington &amp; Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington &amp; Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take


[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda &amp; Chester Bennington]
Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda &amp; Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda &amp; Chester Bennington]
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda &amp; Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there, for you to see
For you to see


[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda &amp; Chester Bennington]
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see, for you to see
[Verse 1]
Save some face, you know you've only got one
Change your ways while you're young
Boy, one day you'll be a man
Oh, girl, he'll help you understand

[Chorus]
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

[Verse 2]
Looking back at sunsets on the East side
We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things slide by so carelessly

[Chorus]
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

[Bridge]
And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did
On the same streets that I did


[Chorus]
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

[Outro]
Oh no, oh, no, no, no
Oh no, oh, no, no, no
[Verse 1]
Made myself a little garden
To grow myself my only friends
Got myself a brand new start and
Oh no, I screwed it up again
Guess I'm stayin' up all night
In my mind but out of sight

[Chorus]
I'm to blame for this
I hide away until the day is through
I will pay for this
Won't find a way to push the blame on you
I won't run from this
Hide away until the day is through

[Verse 2]
Can't believe my eyes this mornin'
I found a plot of weeds instead
Yesterday was so adoring
My god, so easy to offend
I would rather fly than fight
Close my eyes and hang on tight

[Chorus]
I'm not to blame for this
I hide away until the day is through
I will run from this
I'll find a way to push the blame on you
I'll be alright tomorrow
Hide away until the day is through


[Bridge]
It's so simple
It's as easy as it can be
Make a monster
Lock it up, throw away the key

In the backyard
Buried deep underneath the tree
There's a monster
Taking root in the property

[Outro]
In the garden
Where the weeds are now growing free
In the garden
Where my friends plot to bury me
There's a jungle
It's as far as the eye can see
Overgrown now
It's no longer a fantasy
But it's too late
By the time that I realize
I can't see now
'Cause the dirt is up to my eyes
[Verse 1]
Long ago, just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on, just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

[Pre-Chorus]
And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade, you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

[Verse 2]
Came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold

[Pre-Chorus]
And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight


[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

[Bridge]
(Can you hear me?)
(Are you near me?)
(Can we pretend to leave, and then)
(We'll meet again)
When both our cars collide

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
[Verse 1]
Turn away, if you could get me a drink
Of water, 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my Aunt Marie, help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, still, I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you

[Verse 2]
Now turn away, 'cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh, my agony, know that I will never marry
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo
But counting down the days to go, it just ain't living
And I just hope you know

[Outro]
That if you say (If you say...) goodbye today (Goodbye today...)
I'd ask you to be true (I'd ask you to be true...)
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you...
[Verse 1]
Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
Mama, we all go to hell
Oh well, now, Mama, we're all gonna die
Mama, we're all gonna die
Stop asking me questions, I'd hate to see you cry
Mama, we're all gonna die

[Chorus]
And when we go, don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh, so famous
We'll never let you go

[Post-Chorus]
And when you go, don't return to me, my love

[Verse 2]
Mama, we're all full of lies
Mama, we're meant for the flies
And right now, they're building a coffin your size
Mama, we're all full of lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should've raised a baby girl, I should've been a better son
If you could coddle the infection, they can amputate at once
You should've been, I could have been a better son


[Chorus]
And when we go, don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh, so famous
We'll never let you go

[Post-Chorus]
She said, "You ain't no son of mine
For what you've done, they're gonna find
A place for you and just you mind your manners when you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love," that's right!

[Verse 3]
Mama, we all go to hell
Mama, we all go to hell
It's really quite pleasant, except for the smell
Mama, we all go to hell (One, two, three, four!)

[Breakdown]
Mama! Mama! Mama! Oh!
Mama! Mama! Mama! Ma...

[Bridge]
"And if you would call me a sweetheart
I'd maybe then sing you a song..."
But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
You would cry out your eyes all along!


[Outro]
We're damned, after all!
Through fortune and flame, we fall!
And if you can stay, then I'll show you the way
To return from the ashes you call!
We all carry on (We all carry on!) when our
Brothers in arms are gone! (When our brothers in arms are gone!)
So raise your glass high, for tomorrow, we die
And return from the ashes you call!

[Instrumental Outro]
[Intro]
(Luke White on the beat)

[Verse]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like a task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot, then bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', "Fuck it," and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children? Makes you a chump
Look in all the stores you wreckin', nigga, I reckon
Think about the people who own it for 'bout a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But sure, you'd rather hear me say, "Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views,” and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion, all cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder opps, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em, murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, "Fuck it," and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin', go 'head and grab the extension
Give death another one, uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black


[Outro]
We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings (We are the Ku Klux Klan, we hate)
[Intro: Polo G]
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
(Hit-Boy)
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

[Chorus: Polo G]
Natural born hustler, nigga, stuntin' is my strong suit
Flexin' with a hundred cash, look at what these songs do
Gangster and a baller, baby, I do what I want to
I be with some steppers, I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
Wet shit like the Warriors, all my niggas gon' shoot
He gon' have to take a loss, some my niggas gone too
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to
I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi, bitch, these stones new

[Verse 1: Polo G]
Dolce &amp; Gabbanas on my feet and these my favorite pair
Got a lot to lose, still can't be scared to take it there
I was in them slums, shit get dreadful like some Haitian hair
I come from that zoo, it's just cobras, pigs, and apes in there
1300 block, bitch, I caught my last cases there
Ain't no second chances in this shit, so we can't play it fair
Foenem line shit like a barber, Glock knock off his facial hair
Caught him lackin' in his whip, they tryna find his face in there
Lil Hop Out, he stay on go, bitch, all he know is green light
Let off shots with accuracy, showed 'em what that beam like
Posted by that liquor store, was sellin' what the fiends like
Used to wake up in low income, now I live a dream life


[Chorus: Polo G]
Natural born hustler, nigga, stuntin' is my strong suit
Flexin' with a hundred cash, look at what these songs do
Gangster and a baller, baby, I do what I want to
I be with some steppers, I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
Wet shit like the Warriors, all my niggas gon' shoot
He gon' have to take a loss, some my niggas gone too
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to
I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi, bitch, these stones new

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Bury me like a pharaoh with this money and my gold too
Keep a shooter in there, try to rob me, this the wrong tomb
I hit Johnny Dang and mixed the diamonds with the gold tooth
The FN sing a song like it's the leader of a soul group
Don't come 'round here like we friends, you know I don't know you
You know I got demons, allow me to show you
Lately, I been on the road (Yeah), show after show
I know I'm makin' all the opps mad back home
Been a while since I had to dial from a trap phone
See you later, alligator, quite a while, crocodile, we gone
Pray to God that my money stay long
Also prayin' for good aim for when the devil try to go

[Chorus: Polo G]
Natural born hustler, nigga, stuntin' is my strong suit
Flexin' with a hundred cash, look at what these songs do
Gangster and a baller, baby, I do what I want to
I be with some steppers, I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
Wet shit like the Warriors, all my niggas gon' shoot
He gon' have to take a loss, some my niggas gone too
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to
I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi, bitch, these stones new
[Intro: Freddie Mercury]
Mmm num ba de
Dum bum ba be
Doo buh dum ba beh beh

[Verse 1: David Bowie &amp; Freddie Mercury]
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da- that's okay

[Chorus: David Bowie &amp; Freddie Mercury]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Verse 2: David Bowie &amp; Freddie Mercury]
Day day de mm hm
Da da da ba ba
Okay
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours
Ee do ba be
Ee da ba ba ba
Um bo bo
Be lap
People on streets
Ee da de da de
People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da


[Chorus: David Bowie &amp; Freddie Mercury]
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

[Bridge: David Bowie &amp; Freddie Mercury]
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

[Verse 3: Freddie Mercury]
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

[Outro: David Bowie]
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And love (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
[Verse 1]
I just pretend that I'm in the dark
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you

[Chorus]
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you


[Verse 2]
I tried to find love
In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it (Mean it)
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know (Let you know)

[Intro]
It would be so awesome, it would be so cool
It would be the most incredible superhero movie the world has ever seen
The screens would light up with real explosions and special effects
Like, tons and tons of special effects
My super sweet cape would be special effects
And it would blow your mind

[Chorus]
'Cause it's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
It's all about me, yeah, it's all about me
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
You'll be linin' up to see a movie all about me

[Verse 1]
No longer a sidekick, no, that's not me
Picture my booty up in 3-D
I'll shake my booty in my own movie

[Chorus]
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
They'll be linin' up to see a movie all about me

[Verse 2]
I have the most impressive, cool, and scary
Mean and hairy adversary
But not to worry, I'm the man in charge
Yeah, I'd have an alter ego, I'd be a billionaire
Standing tall with adult-sized hands and gorgeous hair
(Gorgeous hair!)


[Chorus]
'Cause it's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
It's all about me, yeah, it's all about me
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
They'll be linin' up to see a movie all about me

[Verse 3]
No longer the sidekick (Sidekicks are lame!)
Now I'm the superhero puttin' villains to shame
R-O-B-I-N is the name!

[Bridge]
Oh, and I have my own hero music, too
It'll go bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum boom!
It would play every time that I entered a room
Then I'd say my sweet and ominous catchphrase:
"Crack an egg on it. Ca-caw!"

[Chorus]
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
It's all about me, yeah, it's all about me
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
They'll be linin' up to see a movie all about me
It's my movie, my movie, my superhero movie
It's all about me, yeah, it's all about me
It's all about me
Every day, I imagine a future where I can be with you
In my hand is a pen that will write a poem of me and you
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
Just move your hand - write the way into his heart!
But in this world of infinite choices
What will it take just to find that special day?
What will it take just to find that special day?

Have I found everybody a fun assignment to do today?
When you're here, everything that we do is fun for them anyway
When I can't even read my own feelings
What good are words when a smile says it all?
And if this world won't write me an ending
What will it take just for me to have it all?

Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me?
Is it love if I take you, or is it love if I set you free?
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
How can I write love into reality?
If I can't hear the sound of your heartbeat
What do you call love in your reality?
And in your reality, if I don't know how to love you
I'll leave you be
Befriend a bastard, a thief as your brother
Heard him say what's yours is mine
Careful when gouging yourself with what's holy
I see through your transparent lies

Skeleton symphonies play psalms to tell you
Your venom has blinded your eyes
Make sure your rope is real strong when you hang me
Better make sure that I die

Your name became Judas the moment I helped you
Should've just let it all lie
If Mammon's the reason for killing your hero
Choke on your evil disguise
[Verse 1]
I really hate you
Stop getting in my way
I've lost my patience
When are you gonna decay?
I want to throw you out
Just like my broken TV
If you'll come back once more
It shall be painful, you'll see

[Chorus]
I hope you die in a fire!
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope, this is what you desire

[Verse 2]
It's almost over
Why can't you just let it fly?
Don't be afraid
It's not the first time you'll die
Your mechanical parts click
Sounds like when I broke your bones
Once I get my second chance
I won't leave you alone


[Chorus]
I hope you die in a fire!
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
I hope you die in a fire!
Hope you'll be stabbed in the heart
Hope you'll get shot and expire
Hope you'll be taken apart
Hope, this is what you desire
I hope you die in a fire!
Ich weiß der Anfang Anzufangen ist hart
Denn manchmal kommt man nicht an Start
Beziehungsweise einfach nicht in fahrt
Aber wenn nicht jetzt wann denn dann?
Beweg dein Arsch! [x2]
Egal ob Autoschieber, Autovermieter
Putze in der Kita, chronischer Verlierer
Multimillionär, armer Schlucker
Radiohörer, Fernsehgucker
Jedem Menschen fällt das Anfangen schwer
Jeder schiebt die Scheiße vor sich her
Ich hab ein ganzen Semester zum Lernen Zeit
Doch fühl mich erst in der letzten Woche dazu bereit
Zu viele Verwandte von mir verdiehnen einen Brief
Aber irgendwie schaff ich das mit dem Schreiben nie
Und ich schwöre man
Ich habe es nicht verplant
Nur der Anfang Anzufangen ist so hart!
Ich weiß der Anfang Anzufangen ist hart
Denn manchmal kommt man nicht an Start
Beziehungsweise einfach nicht in fahrt
Aber wenn nicht jetzt wann denn dann?
Beweg dein Arsch!
(Ohh) [x2]
Beweg dein Arsch!
Du sitzt alleine aufn Sofa
Und starst ins Leere
Träumst davon - wooah
Wie es wohl wäre?!
Mit ner schicken Karre
Vor nem dicken Haus
Umschwärmt von Frauen
Alle sind ein Augenschmaus!
Doch dann wachst du auf
Und wieder ist alles trist
Da hörst du eine Stimme
Die aus der Stille zu dir spricht:
Wenn du nicht Anfängst langsam Anzufangen
Ohne Ägste, Bang und zu zaudern
Dann wirst du Tankwart mit nem Blaumann an
Und nie Blaubart King Of Frauenschwarm!
Wenn du nicht Anfängst langsam Anzufangen
Dann wirst du Handzahm ohne Kanzlerscharm
Verschlossen wie ein Pflanzensamen
Und Kopf durch die Wand wie beim Panzer fahrn
Du wirst Bausparen, Bauplan im Gepäck
Und wirst laut sagen "dein Kran steckt im Dreck!"
Also fang an und wander jetzt vom Fleck!
Alter alternier mal sobald du checkst
Dass was du tust tut dir nicht langen
Also hättest du besser gestern angefangen!
Du Bauer wachst auf und fühlst dich mies
Denn du ahnst das da noch Arbeit liegt
Von gestern Abend und letzter Nacht
Aber schade du hast nichts gemacht
Ich weiß der Anfang Anzufangen ist hart
Denn manchmal kommt man nicht an Start
Beziehungsweise einfach nicht in fahrt
Aber wenn nicht jetzt wann denn dann?
Beweg dein Arsch!
(Ohh) [x2]
Beweg dein Arsch!
Meine Mutter sagt:


Fang mal an
Tu dir keinen Zwang an!
Dag komm mal klar Lan
Tu dir keinen Zwang an!
Dag komm mal klar Lan
Fang doch mal an Mann!
Anfang anzufangen Dag!
Das ist bekannt, dass man anfängt anzufangen
Weil man denkt, man muss langsam anfangen
So wie Kampfsport, Wandern und Gesang
Oder Fangsport, Spannern, Kinderkram!
Man muss langsam anfangen
Anfangen aufzuhören
Mit Raucherzwang
Wird der Gestank dich stören
Aber fang mal erstmal an
Am Anfang anzufangen
Von ganz untern
Und steigere dich dann!
Also mach das genauso
Und lass nichts liegen
Besser heute erledigt
Als sie morgen erliegen
Wir sind alle verschieden
Findens alle schwierig
Richtig anfangen anzufangen, Maaaaann!
(Ohh) [x2]
Beweg dein Arsch!
[Verse 1]
I’ll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I’ll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

[Chorus]
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave

[Verse 2]
I’m not living
I’m just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

[Chorus]
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave

[Verse 3]
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps


[Chorus]
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave

[Verse 1]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 2]
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me
Oooh, oooh

I left a note on my bedpost
Said, "Not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes"
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah, you gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You a part of me now
You a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

[Chorus: Shakira]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2: Rihanna &amp; Shakira, Both]
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow


[Chorus: Shakira &amp; Rihanna]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you

[Bridge: Shakira &amp; Rihanna]
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last time to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy

Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (Oh-oh)
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
[Verse 1: Shakira]
I left a note on my bedpost
Said, "Not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes"
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah, you gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You a part of me now
You a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

[Chorus: Shakira]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2: Rihanna &amp; Shakira, Both]
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go
He a part of me now
He a part of me
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow


[Chorus: Shakira &amp; Rihanna]
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you
Ohh, ohh, I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh, ohh, I can't remember to forget you

[Bridge: Shakira &amp; Rihanna]
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last time to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy

[Intro]
Ooh, I fall apart
Ooh, yeah, mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
She told me that I'm not enough (Yeah)
And she left me with a broken heart (Yeah)
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault (Yeah)
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred (Yeah)
Now there's so many thoughts goin' through my brain (Yeah)
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's Novocaine, yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Verse 2]
Never caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than the liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a whore
Devil in the form of a whore
You said it, no, you said it
No, you said that shit, we'd be together, oh


[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought

[Bridge]
Ice keep pourin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
Covered in scars and I can't help showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep rollin'
Ice keep droppin' and the drink keep flowin'
Try to brush it off, but it keep on goin'
All these scars, can't help from showin'
Whippin' in the foreign and the tears keep blowin', yeah

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Ooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry I bought
You was my shorty, I thought
[Verse 1]
You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over, there's some games you wanna play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
Just me and you and you and me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

[Verse 2]
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you


[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

[Bridge]
Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I want to give you, want to give you
What you need

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

[Outro]
You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't want to leave this play date with you

もう一回
息を吸って
吹き返してみよう
もう一回

[Verse 1]
「叶いそうも無い」
夢はもう見るなと
僕は眠らされた
それでもきっと
夜には目が覚め
追いかけてしまうだろう

[Chorus]
Let’s all believe
We’re crystals on leaves
Evaporate into the sky
Sometimes it’s good
Sometimes it’s bad
されど　我が人生
Hello Hello Hello
New Wall
Hello Hello Hello
New Wall


[Verse 2]
敵いそうも無い
「壁」が立ちはだかって
僕の傷を望むだろう
それでもきっと
どうしようもないくらい
僕はそれを愛するだろう

We’re crystals on leaves
Evaporate into the sky
Sometimes it’s good
Sometimes it’s bad

[Refrain]
Stumbled down
And you fell on the ground
But just follow the sound
So that you’ll be found
Well go on


Stumbled down
And you fell on the ground
But don’t turn around
Now go find your crown
Well go on

[Pre-Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I really run it up, yeah
Ain't play no games with this shit

Flipp with that smoke, on that ganja, I bang for that comma
See, I put my name on this shit

Really don't give a fuck, yeah
How I move, way I talk, they try pick it up
I can call when I want, she be pickin' up
Niggas' bitches, they really be switchin' up
Can't play no game, I got too much to lose
Want me to fall, I got somethin' to prove
Really steal with no trace, I won't leave 'em a clue
And the truck lookin' reggae, I painted it blue
If it's me and my shawty, we hop in the coupe
My lil' youngins go crazy, they lovin' the crew
He handle business, can't wait to recruit him
Pop me a Addy, tryna make me a movie
I can't stand still when my diamonds keep movin' (Movin')
Gave all my heart, tryna guide 'em to do it
Got partners who gon' tryna guide 'em with music
Lil' bro don't play 'round, if he got it, he use it (Use it)
Go against us, nigga gotta be stupid
Ride 'round with the stick, how I gotta be movin' (Man)
Everyday lit and them commas be movin'
This shit we be doin' inside of a movie

[Verse 2: Flipp Dinero]
Rollie don't tick but it got big rocks
Bands in the whip, do the dash from the cops
Chain lookin' bliss, with the pole on my hip (Ayy)
Let me go, I'm equipped, but don't bang with the opps (Ooh)
Pain to regret but it's more that I get
Really made for this shit, money made, it don't stop
Say Heaven sent, I was made for the flip
I was made for this shit and I bang for the block (What?)
Beam and a Jag', got the Benz' on the lot
Went and copped me a crib just to park up the drop (Benz, Benz, gang, gang)
Fuck do you mean? I was lost in the drought (Ayy)
Got the bag comin' into the stars and I'm out (What?)
Money comin' in so you know a nigga goin' (Damn)
Thou on the flip so you know a nigga throw it (What?)
Style ever since in the game I'ma get
Got no time for this shit, get the bag and you know it, bitch


[Pre-Chorus: Flipp Dinero]
I really run it up, yeah
Ain't play no games with this shit
I got that worker from Polo then hit up my guala

Go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
(Great John on the beat by the way)

[Verse: Sleepy Hallow]
My body different
Shorty said she tryna kick it
I'm in her mouth, somethin' like a dentist
Cookin' up, I'm in the kitchen
Big bro wildin', tryna catch a victim
I took an L, but now I'm back, gang winnin'
Look, and I'm doin' well
Don't even ask how I'm livin' (Facts)
Niggas ain't real, they cap (Cap)
Ridin' round with the seat laid back
They told me to chill, I'm itchin' to clap
If I pull up, somebody get whacked
Boy, tie your laces, niggas tripping
Red lights, we gon' skip it
Fucked up a new V, we was dippin'
From the police, I was drillin'
But fuck it, let's skate on, huh
Run up a bag with my bro gods, huh (Bro)
Watch how I show off
Step in the room and she takin' her clothes off
I ain't even say much, huh
Ain't even do much
They like, "Sleepy, you too much"
Know I got a bag, right? Huh
Know I live a fast life
Said she fell in love, met her last night, huh
Said she want this shit for life
Girl, you must be dumb, no, you not the type, huh (What?)
No, I'm not the type
I think I was lost in a past life
Came back, got my cash right
Say you want the sauce, I can get you right
But it's heavyweight, not light (Hold up, hold up)
Bro keep a strap, somethin' like a dyke
He be shootin', he don't like to fight
I could get you wrapped up like a gift
Smoked up like a spliff
Chopper tell 'em back up or get hit
Got my racks up, now I'm lit
I could get you packed up in this bitch
And my blood blue 'cause I'm Crip
Fanny pack full of hundreds (That's a fact)
I just reach on my waist, seen he runnin' (Fuck outta here)
Bitches say a nigga stuntin', huh (Nigga stuntin')
Know they hate how I came up from nothin'
Backed down, get to drummin' (Baow, baow)
I'ma show a nigga how I'm comin'
I was down, now I'm uppin' (Now I'm up)
They was hatin' on me, now they lovin' (Oh wait, hold on)


[Outro: Fousheé]
Go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
[Chorus]
I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie
I remember saying twice baby I shouldn't drive
I should let you hold the keys baby take them inside
If you'd taken my advice, maybe then you'd survived
I've been looking at the sky all night and ain't see shit
Thinking how you died, but you said I could be shit
Now I'm on my grind baby look at me now, look at me now, yeah
All this cash on me make 'em wanna go down
I could fill your cup girl, I could make you slow down
I could show you up baby, I'ma pour a fo'
Sippin' all day baby what you waiting fo'?
If you need a drink I got drugs on me
Gotta watch for the 12 I got drugs on me
I've been going hard, I've been working OT
I'ma make a stack put in on my mommy

[Verse]
Right when I swing at the ground then you blink
I got the drop like you spilling your drink
Fuck what they saying and fuck what they think
I know they gon' love me when Gucci my links
Lines on the sink, pills in the drink
I'm coming and taking the ring


[Chorus]
I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why'd I tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie

I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why'd I tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie
I remember saying twice baby I shouldn't drive
I should let you hold the keys baby take them inside
If you'd taken my advice, maybe then you'd survived
I've been looking at the sky all night and ain't see shit
Thinking how you died, but you said I could be shit
Now I'm on my grind baby look at me now, look at me now, yeah
All this cash on me make em wanna go down
I could fill your cup girl, I could make you slow down
I could show you up baby, I'ma pour a fo'
Sippin' all day baby what you waiting fo'?
If you need a drink I got drugs on me
Gotta watch for the 12 I got drugs on me
I've been going hard, I've been working OT
I'ma make a stack put in on my mommy
[Chorus]
I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie
I remember saying twice baby I shouldn't drive
I should let you hold the keys baby take them inside
If you'd taken my advice, maybe then you'd survived
I've been looking at the sky all night and ain't see shit
Thinking how you died, but you said I could be shit
Now I'm on my grind baby look at me now, look at me now, yeah

If you need a drink I got drugs on me
Gotta watch for the 12 I got drugs on me
I've been going hard, I've been working OT
I'ma make a stack put in on my mommy

[Verse]
Right when I swing at the ground then you blink
I got the drop like you spilling your drink
Fuck what they saying and fuck what they think
I know they gon' love me when Gucci my links
Lines on the sink, pills in the drink
I'm coming and taking the ring


[Chorus]
I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why'd I tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie
I remember saying twice baby I shouldn't drive

[Verse 1]
You always wanted to be
Part of a circus company
For the fun and death defying
But in time you forgot
Life is small in the big top
And your dreams were slowly dying

[Pre-Chorus]
What you wanted
Was not a crime
You could've done it

[Chorus]
Now you're always just a little, a little in the middle
A little in the middle, of where you're bound
Always just a little in the middle
It keeps your head from spinning round

[Verse 2]
Jugglers walk on the wire
Lions leap through hoops of fire
As the acrobats go flying
But what's the show all about?
When did your north get turned to south?
And the truth turn to lying?


[Pre-Chorus]
What you wanted
Was not a crime
You could've done it
But you needed time

[Chorus]
Now you're always just a little, a little in the middle
A little in the middle, of where you're bound
Always just a little in the middle
It keeps your head from spinning round
It keeps your head from spinning

[Bridge]
But it's a hole you're digging
A hole you're digging, you're doing it despite
There so much more you're missing
More you're missing, to your left and to your right

[Chorus]
Now you're always just a little, a little in the middle
A little in the middle, of where you're bound
Always just a little in the middle
It keeps your head from spinning round

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


It keeps your head from spinning round
And round, and round
It keeps your head from spinning round
And round, and round

It keeps your head from spinning
[Part 1: Koljah]
Diese Welt zerfällt - überall Krisen oder Krieg
Die Bienen sterben, Terror in Brüssel und Paris
Die Pole schmelzen, die Regierung macht die Grenzen dicht
Xavier singt, in Europa wird nach rechts gerückt
Das ist echt verrückt! Leute, ist das nötig?
Frieden auf der Welt wär' von heut auf morgen möglich
Ah yeah, wir alle hier sind gleich
Und wir wollen auch das Gleiche - ich kann es dir beweisen:
Es klingelt an der Tür, dann kommt der Lieferant
Mit dem dampfenden Symbol unsrer Hoffnung in der Hand
Die heilige Scheibe, die alle vereint
Die Weisheit der Menschheit, gebacken in Teig

[Hook: Danger Dan]
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Sie verbündet diese Welt
Baby, lass uns Pizza bestell'n!
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Jeder Revolutionär
Braucht nur Pizza und Gewehr!

[Part 2: Danger Dan]
Es geht nicht um Herkunft, Hautfarbe und Religion
Hauptsache, der Teig ist dünn; Hauptsache, Tomatensoße
Hauptsache, Käse; die Welt ist eine Scheibe
Wer grade Pizza isst, tut keinem Menschen was zuleide
Auf jedem Kontinent und in jeder Kultur
Findest du sowas wie Pizza oder ein Pendant dazu
Es geht von Tansania bis zur Münchner Schickeria
Eines Tages wird die ganze Welt zu einer Pizzeria
In jeder Stadt und in jedem Land
Schreibt die Parole an jede Wand!
„Viva la Margherita! Hoch die Calzone!
Feuer und Flamme dem Holzkohleofen!“


[Hook: Danger Dan]
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Sie verbündet diese Welt
Baby, lass uns Pizza bestell'n!
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Jeder Revolutionär
Braucht nur Pizza und Gewehr!

[Part 3: Panik Panzer]
Wenn du mal Probleme hast und wieder mal die Bull'n komm'n
Ist tiefgekühlte Pizza auch ein wunderbares Wurfgeschoss
Wenn sie dich erwischt hab'n, du sitzt im Gerichtssaal
Vergiss nicht: den Richter besticht man mit Pizza!
Wenn es nicht klappt und du fährst ein in den Knast
Dann wird einfach eine Feile in den Teig reingebacken
Pizza ist das Mittel ganze Staaten zu stürzen
Vergiss sie bitte nicht mit Oregano zu würzen

[Hook: Danger Dan]
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Sie verbündet diese Welt
Baby, lass uns Pizza bestell'n!
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Jeder Revolutionär
Braucht nur Pizza und Gewehr!
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Sie verbündet diese Welt
Baby, lass uns Pizza bestell'n!
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Jeder Revolutionär
Braucht nur Pizza und Gewehr!


[Hook: Bela B.] (nur in der Videoversion)
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Sie verbindet diese Welt
Baby, lass uns Pizza bestell'n!
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Jeder Revolutionär
Braucht nur Pizza und Gewehr!
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Sie verbindet diese Welt
Baby, lass uns Pizza bestell'n!
Oh, ich glaube fest daran
Dass uns Pizza retten kann!
Jeder Revolutionär
Braucht nur Pizza und Gewehr!
[Verse 1]
Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me, 'cause I can't keep wondering why
And no, it's not a phase, 'cause it happens all the time
Start over, check again, now tell me what you find

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?

[Chorus]
It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice

[Verse 2]
Am I broken? What's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me, 'cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight, 'cause I'm running out of time
I need an antidote, now what can you prescribe?

[Chorus]
It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going under


[Post-Chorus]
I need a cure for me, 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy, 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me, 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy, 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?

[Chorus]
It's like an avalanche, I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance, my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going under

[Post-Chorus]
I need a cure for me, 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy, 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me, 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy, 'cause when it hits, well, it hits like an avalanche
[Intro]
Nightmare!
Now your nightmare comes to life

[Verse 1]
Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever (Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed (Burn the world your last endeavor)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life

[Verse 2]
Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason (Loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
"Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications"


[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Fight (Fight!), not to fail (Fail!), not to fall (Fall!)
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (Die!), die again (Die!), drenched in sin (Sin!)
With no respect for another, oh!
Down (Down!), feel the fire (Fire!), feel the hate (Hate!)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!), hit the wall (Wall!), watch you crawl (Crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life

[Chorus]
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
[Strophe 1]
Es is so schön, dass es mich gibt
du hast Glück, dass du mich triffst
dein Gesicht ist ein Gemälde
Eine reine Poesie
Bist zwar nicht schlauer als ein Schaf aber scharf
Ich bin in Love wie Jack und Rose auf dem Big Screen
Kann ich bitte deine Tits sehen
Baby siehst du nicht der Mond
Ich hab ihn für dich aufgehängt
Und die Sterne hin gepinnt
Ich glaub ich spinn'
wenn ich dich heute Nacht nicht-
Ah ah ah sei doch kein Kind

[Refrain]
Wem du's heute kannst besorgen
dem besorgst du's morgen auch
Denk an deine Zukunft,
denk dran, was du später einmal brauchst
Ein Auto, Haus mit Garten
zieh dich aus, du kleine Maus
Wem du's heute kannst besorgen
Ich besorg's dir morgen auch

[Strophe 2]
Cuba Libre für uns beide
Oder eine Flasche Wein
Baby Beine wie die deinen
Hat hier keine zweite nein
Lass mich bitte von der Leine
Ich beiße nicht ich trink dich aus
als wär' ich Alkoholiker und du Tanqueray


[Refrain]
Wem du's heute kannst besorgen
dem besorgst du's morgen auch
Denk an deine Zukunft,
denk dran, was du später einmal brauchst
Ein Auto, Haus mit Garten
zieh dich aus, du kleine Maus
Wem du's heute kannst besorgen
Ich besorg's dir morgen auch

[Bridge]
Du bist zwar erst sechzehn
Komm wir drehen Sexszenen
Gib mir nur ein Küsschen
Lass mich dich etwas kitzeln
Etwas Nähe ist nicht schlimm
Sei doch kein Kind

[Refrain]
Wem du's heute kannst besorgen
dem besorgst du's morgen auch
Denk an deine Zukunft,
denk dran, was du später einmal brauchst
Ein Auto, Haus mit Garten
zieh dich aus, du kleine Maus
Wem du's heute kannst besorgen
Ich besorg's dir morgen auch
[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had


[Bridge]
Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
[Songtext zu „Anders schön“]

[Hook]
Die freie Sicht genießen
Wenn man am Abgrund steht
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Es fühlt sich an wie Fliegen
Wenn sie uns fall'n seh’n
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön

[Part 1]
Kleiner Junge neben Mama vor dieser Frau am Schalter:
„Sag, warum guckst du denn so traurig, Kleiner?“
Die Frage kennt er schon, sie laufen weiter, als läge über ihm
Ein grauer Schleier, der verhindert dass er nach außen scheinen kann
Und auf der Leinwand, sieht er perfekte Menschen
Mit Siegerlächeln, die glänzen und alles mit guter Laune meistern
Es braucht 'ne Weile, ihn aufzuheitern, doch Mama sagt:
„Auch der Pausenclown hat Augen, die mal geweint haben“
Die anderen haben's auch nicht einfach, nur traut’s sich keiner
Da draußen zu zeigen - traurig und einsam sind doch nur Außenseiter
Es kommt nicht darauf an, wer lauter schrei'n kann
Auch zuhör'n kann den Raum bereichern und Frauen begeistern
Was du siehst, sieht kaum ein Zweiter
Du erkennst die Magie in der Melancholie, also zauber einfach
Im Lauf der Zeit fällt das Laufen leichter
Und du begreifst, da liegt Schönheit in allem, auch im Scheitern


[Hook]
Die freie Sicht genießen
Wenn man am Abgrund steht
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Es fühlt sich an wie Fliegen
Wenn sie uns fall'n seh'n
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön

[Part 2]
Hallo Schmerz! Ist lange her, dass du mich
Zum aller ersten Mal gelehrt hast: „Junge, du kannst nicht mehr“
Die Ambulanz vorm Ascheplatz hat gedacht, ich sterb'
Die Spannungsherde im Kopf und der erste Cut ins Herz
Hab' bald gemerkt es gibt Sachen, die kann kein Arzt entfern'n
Wurd’ abgehärtet und hab’ mich lange von Hass ernährt
Ich dachte mehr als nur einmal „Ist das dein fucking Ernst?!“
Doch manches Drama war hinterher nur ein'n Lacher Wert
Haben uns angenähert und zusamm’n gelernt
Nie mehr will ich dich betäuben, auch wenn du manchmal nervst
Ach Schmerz, ab und an hab ich dich ehrlich gern
Wanderer über dem Scherbenmeer

[Hook]
Die freie Sicht genießen
Wenn man am Abgrund steht
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Es fühlt sich an wie Fliegen
Wenn sie uns fall'n seh'n
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön


[Bridge]
Immer wieder Anlauf nehmen
In jedem Waldbrand einen neuen Anfang sehen
Immer dann merken, dass man lebt, wenn das Blatt sich dreht
Weil der Sturm jeden Plan zerschlägt
Wenn sich das Dunkle in mir mit den guten Dingen verkoppelt
Naturidylle, Tschernobyl
Ich such' das Weite, bin gerne alleine
Um mir mal alles von der Seele zu Schweigen

[Hook]
Die freie Sicht genießen
Wenn man am Abgrund steht
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Es fühlt sich an wie Fliegen
Wenn sie uns fall’n seh'n
Es gibt manche Dinge
Die sind anders schön
Wir sind anders schön
Wir sind anders schön
[Verse 1]
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing (Mmmm)
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation


[Pre-Chorus]
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

[Bridge]
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back (Oh whoa)
There's nothing holdin' me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
[Verse 1]
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Verse 2]
You look so beautiful in this light
You silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness


[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

[Bridge]
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

[Chorus]
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love


[Outro]
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment I knew you, Beth

[Verse 1]
I don't want a friend (Just one more night)
I want my life in two (My life in two)
Please one more night
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (Waiting for you)
Just one more night
I'm done fighting all night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?

[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark

[Verse 2]
When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you (My voice in you)
Shutting me out you (Shutting me out)
Doing so great (So great, so great)
You


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah (When you fall, when you fall)
I don't fuck with your tone (I don't fuck with your tone)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?

[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark
[Intro: Tyler, The Creator &amp; Playboi Carti]

Don't, do-do-do-do-do, I'll need-
[Verse 1: Josh]
I hate to break it to you but
You're just a lonely star
I try to bring you down but
A level isn't good enough
You always do as you please
So I'm gonna follow suit
And take a seat
And watch you fall apart
Cause in the end
What are you without me?

[Bridge: Josh]
I slow this down cause I know that you can't keep up
Oh maybe I, maybe I was wrong from the start
I might be proud, but at least I'm proud of something
You've taken pride in becoming nothing

[Chorus: Josh]
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me


[Verse 2: Josh]
I'm married to the music
For better or for worse
You say that I'm privileged but
My gift is my curse
I can't recall the last time
Someone asking how I was
Last I checked I was a fucking wreck
I called for help and no one showed up
So I sit in the dirt

[Chorus: Josh]
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me

[Verse 3: Oli Sykes]
Just forget what you've learned
Just forget what you've heard
The truth just confirmed
I can't bear the sight of you anymore
You've become what I hate
Sold yourself for a bit of fame
Now that the wolves have closed the door
You wanna drag me down some more
Fuck you
Fuck you


[Chorus 3: Josh]
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury


[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift &amp; Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift &amp; Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door


[Outro: Justin Vernon &amp; Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many signs) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah
[Intro: Prince Paul]
Alrighty
Prince Paul
Uh, ah

[Chorus: 2-D]
You can freak me out, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can borrow my hands and tell me I'm not here
I'm a mad Pac-Man, livin' in a leveled world
Everywhere I go I don't know where I am

[Verse 1: 2-D]
You can call me cracked, you can call me mad and stifled
You can hold my hand, sail me into bathing light
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, no stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out, stressin' out

[Chorus: 2-D]
You can hide your head, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can borrow my days and tell me I'm not blue
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

[Break: 2-D]
No stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out


[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, how can I trust truth?
Uh, when I ain't got nothin' to sell
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh, why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tails?
Ayy, can't dream if my ego is broke, nah
The jokes that try to find the answer to nope (Uh)
My type of drive, you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark, then my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix

[Break: 2-D &amp; ScHoolboy Q]
(I'm a mad Pac-Man) Suu
(Livin' in a leveled world)

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, I been at the top of the top
Fell from the ceiling before I fail
'Cause I needed to grow, Bruce Lee, royal with the glow
Uh, walked on the edge, fuck tryna dream in the bed
'Fore I die on these meds, niggas gon' die on the feds
'Fore I make it to jail, prolly put one in the head
Fuck the judge and the prosecutor for hangin' me dead
Plus thirty and still movin', I'm closer to live, right?
Closer to live, right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now, can't be stuck in the red lights
Take flight, the life gon' bloom for the Black Knight
Keep a piece, no Buddhist, got the whole hood boomin'
I'm like a Crip how I stewed it, you on your ass, stuck, stupid
You makin' we look bad, I rock the beat, won't crash
I had to fill my bag, I had to hide my stash
You know the cops' lights flash, I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag, I gave the hood my last
Every full-grown minute, I had to change my image
The brain don't got limits, you think a mill' mean winnin'
Pigs out here skinnin', your soul ain't authentic
You died and still ain't livin'
[Verse]
The bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
With the bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
Cause I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a second

[Chorus]
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

[Post-Chorus]
Oooh, la la la
Oooh, la la la
Oooh, la la la
Oooh


[Verse]
The bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
With the bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
Cause I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a second

[Chorus]
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

[Bridge]
I don't find it funny right now (right now)
Just want my ma-ma-ma-money right now (now)
I'm on my way to the party right now (right now)
I don't find it funny right now (right now)
Just want my ma-ma-ma-money right now (now)
I'm on my way to the party right now (right now)
Because the break, the break, the break


[Chorus]
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up

Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

Ah, ah
[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me


[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Intro Chorus]
It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
And we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing!

[Verse]
The deeper you dig, the darker it gets
There's nowhere else for us to go
We live what we learn, and then we forget
We'll never find our way back home, come on!

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane
The wolves are at my door

[Chorus]
It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end, and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing


[Breakdown]
I hear 'em clawing at the gates
(Let us in! Let us in!)
I hear them calling out my name
I don't care
Let them sing! Let them sing! Let them sing!
Let the bastards sing
Let them sing! Let them sing!
Let the bastards sing
Let them sing! Let them sing!
Let the bastards sing
Let the godforsaken bastards sing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane
The wolves are at my door
But I can't see the writing on the walls
The wolves are at my door
Waiting for my empire to fall

[Chorus]
It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing
[Verse 1]
He was just a dolphin (dolphin), swimming in the sea
With his dolphin friends (friends), happy as can be
Until one day he went (ohhh) and ventured onto land
And he got bitten by a radioactive man
Now he's Dolphin Man (man), half dolphin, half man
Hear him screech at night, cause he just wants a friend
There'll be quite a fright (Jesus Christ) if you run into him
In the dark, abandoned house where he lives (Ohh)

[Bridge]
You know he may come off strong, but he's not what he seems
If he ever catches you, you can bet that you'll scream

[Chorus]
Like help, let me go, help, let me go
Help, let me go, let me go tonight
You'll scream, help, let me go
Help, let me go, help, let me go, stop kidnapping me

[Verse 2]
She was just a lady, not a care in the world
'Till she saw some grown men (grown men), kidnapping a girl
She said "Help, let me go", so she sprung into action
Then she looked right at a necklace
And became Scarlett Johansson
Then she kicked all their asses, Varli, savior of the masses
Don't know where that necklace came from
Love more, hate less, that's the message
Dolphin Man saw her on TV and gave her a call
They formed the best crime-fighting team in the world (Ohh)


[Bridge]
Then they saved the president from an alien race
It was all over the news, he was screaming in space

[Chorus]
Like, help, let me go, help, let me go
Help, let me go, let me go tonight
He said, help, let me go, help, let me go
Help, let me go, stop kidnapping me
Help, let me go, help, let me go
Help, let me go, let me go tonight
He said, help, let me go, help, let me go
Help, let me go, stop kidnapping me

[Verse 1]
When you're feeling so very, very low
Keep breathing, there’s nothing wrong
You know I'm right here, just play with me
It all will be clear, I'ma tell you who I am now

[Chorus]
I’m a cat, I play the bongo
Dance all, dance all night
I'm a cat, I play the bongo
Dance all, dance all night
When we purr and meow all day
It's the bongo we must play
Here we go, here we go, here we go
(Here we go, here we go)

[Verse 2]
So, do you feel the love that I have for you?
You know I love everything about you
Like the moonlight
That's what I like about you
Eyes shine so bright, don't be sad
I'll play the bongo with you!

[Bridge]
Can you feel it?
Yeah, oh
Can you hear it?
Don't be sad
Just play the bongo with me!


[Chorus]
I'm a cat, I play the bongo
Dance all, dance all night
I’m a cat, I play the bongo
Dance all, dance all night

Here we go, here we go, here we go
(Here we go, here we go)
I'm a cat, I play the bongo
Dance all, dance all night
I’m a cat, I play the bongo
Dance all, dance all night
When we purr and meow all day
It's the bongo we must play
Here we go, here we go, here we go

When we purr and meow all day
It's the bongo we must play
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself


[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself


[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]
She stares at her ceiling once again with a hundred thoughts
"Maybe he knows who I am; probably not"
She walks down the hall with her head down low, scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice she's swarmed with butterflies

[Chorus]
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Verse 2]
He always walks the crowded halls and is blinded by this light
A girl who keeps her head down low and never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her but there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice she runs away

[Chorus]
Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Bridge]
One day maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day she'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking, she'll call him mine
One day he'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet face to face
One day he'll look into her eyes
And say that, "You're my only light"


[Chorus]
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I understand that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside
[Chorus: YG]
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up
And we used to fuck but I got fed up
We eatin', all my niggas fed up
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up
And we used to fuck but I got fed up
We eatin', all my niggas fed up

[Verse 1: YG]
You a ho rat, that pussy throwback
I’m tryna fuck, you ain’t gotta be a scientist to know that
Been to that money, nothin’ before that
Bitch I’ll do you dirty, dirty like a floor mat
Yeah I’m tired of hearin’ about what you need, bitch
I’m tired of payin' for yo weaves, bitch
I’m tired of you fuckin’ me, tryin’ to get pregnant
Knowin’ if you had a baby yo broke ass couldn’t help it
I be ridin’ through the city bumpin’ 2 Chainz
I ain’t worried ‘bout the police, I got two names
Keep a strap 'cause sometimes you gotta do things
She give away that pussy like loose change
Tryna have a nigga baby, be sellin that va-jay-jay
This ain’t recess, bitch you know I don’t play-play
Just bought a A-K, just took a vacay
Bitch you broke, you need to call Triple A, ayy


[Chorus: YG]
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up
And we used to fuck but I got fed up
We eatin', all my niggas fed up
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up
And we used to fuck but I got fed up
We eatin', all my niggas fed up

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
How you fuck for cash but you not a ho?
And how I’m gon’ respect you if your pockets broke?
On your rap sheet a whole lot of bros
It’s a clinic on Western but you outta go
You’re broke, your pussy stink, you borrow clothes
Lost the little ass that you had playin’ with your nose
I dedicate this to my last ho
Swear I got cash and started actin’ like a asshole
Catch up, keep up, Cutlass with the beat up
I be buyin’ pounds, so naw we can’t peace up
Rollie with the crown, bet you wanna fuck the king, huh?
It’s money over bitches, pussy never fuck this thing up
She still fannin' when she seen us
I’m a Grade A nigga, you'se a C+
I got a room, I got a broom, bitch, clean up
Hit the blade, and play my fee up


[Chorus: YG]
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up
And we used to fuck but I got fed up
We eatin', all my niggas fed up
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up
And we used to fuck but I got fed up
We eatin', all my niggas fed up

[Verse 3: YG]
You shopping at Louis when your baby need WIC
Using vibrators when you know you need dick
Bitch you sick, ho you trifling
I heard in the ‘hood your pussy be cyclin’
Nobody wifin’ yo ass
Young nigga got dick, no yak
[Fast money] fast bitches takin’ ho baths
And me and relations don’t last
My nigga Mustard got the benzo my clips got extendos
I’m hangin’ out the window, bangin’ out the window
Throw it up chunky — wrists on chunky
I heard the homie fucked and your pussy smell funky
And I ain’t used to what you used to
The only thing in your ear is a Bluetooth
You niggas ain’t blinged-out, 20 racks I blow that
5-10-15 I let my niggas hold that


[Chorus: YG]
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up
And we used to fuck but I got fed up
We eatin', all my niggas fed up
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up
And we used to fuck but I got fed up
We eatin', all my niggas fed up
[Chorus: YG]
Bitch you broke, shut up
Don’t talk to me, get your bread up

[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing


[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else


[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Ever since I left the city…

[Verso 1: Edi Rock]
Negro drama, entre o sucesso e a lama
Dinheiro, problemas, inveja, luxo, fama
Negro drama, cabelo crespo e a pele escura
A ferida, a chaga, à procura da cura
Negro drama, tenta ver e não vê nada
A não ser uma estrela, longe, meio ofuscada
Sente o drama, o preço, a cobrança
No amor, no ódio, a insana vingança
Negro drama, eu sei quem trama e quem tá comigo
O trauma que eu carrego pra não ser mais um preto fodido
O drama da cadeia e favela
Túmulo, sangue, sirene, choros e velas
Passageiro do Brasil, São Paulo, agonia
Que sobrevive em meio às honras e covardias
Periferias, vielas, cortiços
Você deve tá pensando o que você tem a ver com isso
Desde o início, por ouro e prata
Olha quem morre, então, veja você quem mata
Recebe o mérito, a farda que pratica o mal
Me ver pobre preso ou morto já é cultural
Histórias, registros, escritos
Não é conto, nem fábula, lenda ou mito
Não foi sempre dito que preto não tem vez? Então
Olha o castelo e não
Foi você quem fez, cuzão
Eu sou irmão dos meus trutas de batalha
Eu era a carne, agora sou a própria navalha
Tim-tim! Um brinde pra mim
Sou exemplo de vitórias, trajetos e glórias
O dinheiro tira um homem da miséria
Mas não pode arrancar, de dentro dele, a favela
São poucos que entram em campo pra vencer
A alma guarda o que a mente tenta esquecer
Olho pra trás, vejo a estrada que eu trilhei, mó cota
Quem teve lado a lado e quem só ficou na bota
Entre as frases, fases e várias etapas
Do quem é quem, dos manos e das minas fracas
Hmm, negro drama de estilo
Pra ser, se for, tem que ser; se temer, é milho
Entre o gatilho e a tempestade
Sempre a provar que sou homem e não um covarde
Que Deus me guarde, pois eu sei que ele não é neutro
Vigia os ricos, mas ama os que vêm do gueto
Eu visto preto por dentro e por fora
Guerreiro, poeta entre o tempo e a memória, ora
Nessa história, vejo dólar e vários quilates
Falo pro mano que não morra e, também, não mate
O tique-taque não espera, veja o ponteiro
Essa estrada é venenosa e cheia de morteiro
Pesadelo? Hmm, é um elogio
Pra quem vive na guerra, a paz nunca existiu
No clima quente, a minha gente sua frio
Vi um pretinho: seu caderno era um fuzil


[Interlúdio: Mano Brown]
Crime, futebol, música... Caralho!
Eu também não consegui fugir disso, aí
Eu sou mais um
Forrest Gump é mato
Eu prefiro contar uma história real
Vou contar a minha

[Verso 2: Mano Brown]
Daria um filme
Uma negra e uma criança nos braços
Solitária na floresta de concreto e aço
Veja, olha, outra vez, o rosto na multidão
A multidão é um monstro sem rosto e coração
Ei, São Paulo, terra de arranha-céu
A garoa rasga a carne, é a Torre de Babel
Família brasileira: dois contra o mundo
Mãe solteira de um promissor vagabundo
Luz, câmera e ação!
Gravando, a cena vai
Um bastardo, mais um filho pardo sem pai
Ei, senhor de engenho, eu sei bem quem você é
Sozinho 'cê num 'guenta, sozinho 'cê num 'guenta, a pé
'Cê disse que era bom e a favela ouviu
Lá também tem uísque e Red Bull, tênis Nike e fuzil
Admito, seus carros é bonito
É, e eu não sei fazer
Internet, vídeo-cassete, uns carros loucos
Atrasado eu tô um pouco, sim, tô, eu acho
Só que tem que—
Seu jogo é sujo e eu não me encaixo
Eu sou problema de montão, de carnaval a carnaval
Eu vim da selva, eu sou leão, sou demais pro seu quintal
Problema com escola eu tenho mil, mil fitas
Inacreditável, mas seu filho me imita
No meio de vocês, ele é o mais esperto
Ginga e fala gíria
"Gíria, não, dialeto!"
Esse não é mais seu, ó, fiiiuuu— Subiu
Entrei pelo seu rádio, tomei, 'cê nem viu
"Nóis é isso, é aquilo"
O quê? 'Cê não dizia?
Seu filho quer ser preto, ah! Que ironia
Cola o pôster do 2Pac, aí, que tal? O que 'cê diz?
Sente o negro drama, vai, tenta ser feliz
Ei, bacana, quem te fez tão bom assim?
O que 'cê deu, o que 'cê faz, o que 'cê fez por mim?
Eu recebi seu tique— quer dizer, kit
De esgoto a céu aberto e parede madeirite
De vergonha, eu não morri, tô firmão, eis-me aqui
Você, não, 'cê não passa quando o Mar Vermelho abrir
Eu sou humano, homem duro, do gueto, Brown, Obá
Aquele louco que não pode errar
Aquele que você odeia amar nesse instante
Pele parda e ouço funk
Vim de onde vêm os diamantes: da lama
Valeu, mãe, negro drama


[Saída: Mano Brown]
Aí... Na época dos barraco de pau lá na Pedreira
Onde cês tavam? O que é que cês deram por mim? O que é que cês fizeram por mim?
Agora tá de olho no dinheiro que eu ganho?
Agora tá de olho no carro que eu dirijo?
Demorô, eu quero é mais, eu quero até sua alma
Aí, o rap fez eu ser o que sou
Ice Blue, Edi Rock e KL Jay, e toda a família
E toda geração que faz o rap, a geração que revolucionou
A geração que vai revolucionar
Nos anos 90, século 21, é desse jeito
Aí, você sai do gueto, mas o gueto nunca sai de você, morô irmão?
Voce tá dirigindo um carro, o mundo todo tá de olho em você, morô?
Sabe por quê? Pela sua origem, morô irmão?
É desse jeito que você vive, é o Negro Drama
Eu não li, eu não assisti
Eu vivo o Negro Drama, eu sou o Negro Drama
Eu sou o fruto do Negro Drama
Aí, Dona Ana, sem palavras, a senhora é uma rainha, rainha
Mas aí, se tiver que voltar pra favela, eu vou voltar de cabeça erguida
Porque assim que é, renascendo das cinzas
Firme e forte, guerreiro de fé
Vagabundo nato!
Like an angel with cruel and merciless intent
Go forth, young boy, and you’ll become a legend

In time, this blue of the sky
Will reach out to knock on the door to your heart
You’re looking at me
Make it all that you see

Content and we’re merely smiling

Once more, the touch you long for
Consumes you in yearning to find that embrace
You’re unaware though
Now to what fate will sow
Temptation implores you to know

Someday you’ll notice – I pray that you’ll realize
These wings on your back aren’t a dream
At last, you’ll have all you need to escape to
The world where you’ll finally be free

This was all a Cruel Angel’s Thesis from the start
Brought to life, out window now it’s taking flight
Scorching pathos if you betray your memory
Follow this deviant-divine philosophy


Shining more than these stars that bathe the galaxy
Go forth, young boy, and you’ll become a legend

With grace, and in my embrace
You fall deep into sleep, so tempted to stay
In the morning that falls
You alone will be called
By message from the realm of dreams

Moonlight reflects in your sight
The night that surrounds you invites radiance
And it’s all in goodwill
But if time could stand still
This moment, I’d freeze it in place

If there is meaning in two people meeting
Then maybe we’re doing this right
Within this trial, that might be the bible -
The way that we’ll both reach the light


This was all a Cruel Angel’s Thesis from the start
It is time, for the sorrow in us to arise
You held tightly to all that’s left and tangible
Stuck between both the dream world and the actual
You out-shine any mortal who has walked the Earth
Go forth, young boy, and you’ll become a legend


People who weave love, create without knowing
And carve a path through history
Though I’ll take a stand
I’m still only human
The goddess you need can (not) be me

This was all a Cruel Angel’s Thesis from the start
Brought to life, out window now it’s taking flight
Scorching pathos if you betray your memory
Follow this deviant-divine philosophy

Shining more than these stars that bathe the galaxy
Go forth, young boy, and you’ll become a legend
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby


[Breakdown: DJ Snake]

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough yeah
Know we're good enough

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby


[Breakdown: DJ Snake]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah, nah, nah
I won't give up, nah, nah, nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby
[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, "Yeah, I'm good at little league."
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm


[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm


[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Outro: Mary Lambert]

(Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Yeah)
Rio:

Καθώς αφήναμε τη γη για μια κόλαση
Κοιτούσα μέσα απ'τη σιωπή κι ήταν όλοι εκεί
Να αφήσω την οργή να βγει σε μια πόλη γκρι
Δεν θα πεθαίναμε μαζί όλα θαλλασί
Θέλεις να νιώσω το κενό πέσε πρώτα εσύ
Ενώ σου καίμε το μυαλό σε μια πρόταση
Έχω μια ανάμνηση νεκρή και μετά απ'αυτή
Δεν θα αντικρίσουμε μαζί την ανατολή
Η νύχτα γίνεται γλυκιά κι αλλάζει μορφή
Μα ξημερώνει και η καρδιά της μένει μισή
Άμα θα πέσει μια φορά θα αναγεννηθεί
Ενώ πεθαίνουν στο όνομά της χίλιοι πιστοί
Και δεν ανήκει πουθενά τώρα κόλαση
Μπορεί να φέρει τη βροχή πάνω απ'το νησί
Να αφήσει το κακό να δει πιο βαθιά να μπει
Γιατί δεν πάτησε ποτέ στην άγονη γη

Δεν με γεμίζει η σελήνη το καίω σόλο
Μη μπλέκεις με το Φι Βήτα Σι θα μου δώσεις κώλο
Ζεις μόνος πεθαίνεις κάτω απ'το θόλο
Η φλόγα μου θα καίει για πάντα στο μέγα θρόνο (x2)

Χορεύοντας με τον θάνατο
Μπαίνω στην μάχη για να πιω και μετά να δω
Πόλη μου μες στον πυρετό και μετά απ' αυτό
Βγάζει μέσα στον οργασμό της το Σάββατο
Με τα feelings δανεικό μες στον εθισμό
Σε ένα τόπο μαγικό μες τον πειρασμό
Έρχεται μέσα απ'τον καπνό σα παιδί μικρό
Με ένα χαμόγελο μισό και μετά νεκρό
Πέφτουμε από τον ουρανό μα μαζί και οι δυό
Άνοιξ' τα πόδια σου να δω και μετά να μπω
Να σου γαμήσω το μυαλό και μετά να βγω
Πουτάνα μες τον πυρετό ζω τον πόλεμο
Εγώ δεν ήμουνα άγγελος μα ούτε κεραυνός
Άφησα τις ελπίδες μου πάνω απ'το πέλαγος
Σκοτάδι και έρεβος πνίγομαι από την έρημο
Το καίω σόλο γυρίζω με την πανσέληνο


Δεν με γεμίζει η σελήνη το καίω σόλο
Μη μπλέκεις με το Φι Βήτα Σι θα μου δώσεις κώλο
Ζεις μόνος πεθαίνεις κάτω απ'το θόλο
Η φλόγα μου θα καίει για πάντα στο μέγα θρόνο (x2)
[Chorus] - Rainbow Kitten Surprise
My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?
We die alone, we'll all die young
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?

[VERSE 1] - Zach Boucher
I feel hopeless, not like anything would notice
'til it's too late and they see me lose control of emotions
I've been broken, not too many moments i'm open
Can't cope, I can feel it in me like an explosion

Yet now, i'm tryna get better, but can't change
I keep it inside til I can't and the pain stings
Don't know why I feel like I damage the same things
Look, I promise that I'm able to handle what they bring

I just gotta keep a level head
They won't get me to believe that i'd be better dead
Got a list of everything you'll wish you never said
But what if now it happens and I couldn't make it end

They're gonna pay
I won't let you live another day, there is no escape
This is fate that you couldn't change
Even if you prayed


Stay away, don't make a mistake
Nothing but a fake, that'll break
All that I can say is
What else can you take?

'cause

[Chorus] - Rainbow Kitten Surprise
My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?
We die alone, we'll all die young
What you care to die for? What you care to die for? (x2)

[VERSE 2] - Zach Boucher
I get lost in thought and stop talking
Drop my own conscious, til I can't breathe
Doesn't happen often, no control if I wanted
Not too many can stop it, isn't because i'm weak

Keep it hidden, yeah I know i'm different
Just because I'm me
Never used to someone listening
If I would ever speak

Not finished, yeah there's something missing
Never been complete
Or had a hold on emotions at very least
Needed peace


I can bottle up a lot before it leaks
The truth is I do this for you not for me
I used to be foolish enough to believe
That there has to be limits for what we achieve

But there isn't
Only if you're in the wrong crowds
Lacking the support can bring you all down
They don't want to see when I go all out
Just lacking the confidence, i'm all doubt

Creating a fallout

[Chorus] - Rainbow Kitten Surprise
My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?
We die alone, we'll all die young
What you care to die for? What you care to die for? (x2)

[VERSE 3] - Zach Boucher
I think I get lost in myself a little
Struggle on what's good or bad, i'm in the middle
Overthinking, overzealous, over something simple
I think I need some Independence 'cause i'm in a pickle

Say i'm being used, hit me like a missile
If you try to say that it's the truth


It was innocent, the difference is that "it" was never you
Doing anything for anyone to ever pay a due
And you know that i'd give everything for us to never lose

That was true and myself can't top it
Everybody move, I need help, I've lost it
Got a mental bruise, when I lose my conscious
And I won't ever prove to you dudes, i'm not this

I barely got feelings left to express
You don't know half the pain or half of the stress
Not too sure how to change or how to progress
With regret, but it's been something I couldn't ever forget

I'm used to keeping it in

[Chorus] - Rainbow Kitten Surprise
My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?
We die alone, we'll all die young
What you care to die for? What you care to die for? (x2)

Vida bela é novela, testa a gravidade e volta com o pé no chão
As leoa, eu sequela, me apaixonei não dá pra falar que não
Vendo fantasma e as garça, as onça, as linda, e as falsa impressão
Devia aprender sem errar, mas não dá, queria viver sem ter que me preocupar
Ensinem seus filhos a não acreditarem em tudo
Ensinem seus filhos a não acreditarem em tudo
Vida bela é novela, testa a gravidade e volta com o pé no chão
As leoa, eu sequela, me apaixonei não dá pra falar que não
Vendo fantasma e as garça, as onça, as linda, e as falsa impressão (passou batido)
Devia aprender sem errar, mas não dá, queria viver sem ter que me preocupar
Ensinem seus filhos a não acreditarem em tudo
Ensinem seus filhos a não acreditarem em tudo

[Verso 1: Raillow]
Eram 3 da manhã, enquanto o povo dormia
Discutiam rendas públicas e pra onde o país ia
Eu não entendi, não entendia
Por baixo dos tapetes da CIA
Um navio no oceano transporta agonias
Hospitais parados e a vingança na veia
B.O na meia e meia hora pro fim da vida
Eu vim das ilhas, onde o amor era tudo que tinha
Eu vim pra vida real com mó trânsito na avenida
Desvio, Tiquatira
A quebrada quer mas não observa
Que levaram minha erva, mas roubaram minha tia
Só merda na quebra e o desmanche de veículos
As piores químicas pra uma zona esquecida
Mas não esqueci cresci na vida
Enquanto MC's se atacavam na calada da noite o congresso escolhia
Qualquer progresso já era
Alguma esperança não vinha
Seguimos na guerra dos eu te amo na orgia
[Verso 2: Leal]
Nunca foi fácil, eu nem quis que fosse
Foda-se, ser melhor que ontem é o que tem pra hoje
Eu não vou me render ao ideal de Washington, não me convence
O Temer de informante foi pra presidente
E cê nem percebe que o seu voto muda quase nada ou nunca mudará
Ou você faz acontecer ou vai viver pra esperar
Terceirizam empresas pro pobre não subir de classe
O boy cu que nunca faz nada ganha como se fizesse
Informação pouca, a vida é louca
Eu ligo uma coisa na outra
E só assim meu pensamento se faz vivo
Não fico de toca, a lei é outra, mente blindada é poucas
Minha opinião não é o que tá escrito no livro, porra
1995, não minto, as cartas ditam tudo as cartas falam tudo
E provam pros que não acreditam
Céticos, médicos, comprovam e provam a imagem ama
Enfermeiros pros enfermos sem cura machuca
É sempre aquilo lá, pílulas, cujos efeitos colaterais já anularam da bula
E eu não pago mico pra ter onça, responsa não é só nas linha
E eu queria ser só seu, mas você nunca foi minha
A culpa traz o medo e move quando sussurra na nuca
E o que nunca vai mudar, merda é o que mais machuca
O tempo não para a vida não espera, já era mais um parceiro
Moro onde a fé move montanha de dinheiro e foda-se
[Verso 3: Gali]
Aspecto sombrio
Espectro maldito
Spectra weril, navalha de aço afiaram o fio
Golpe rasga a sangue frio
Vidraça quebrada sangue no chão
Quem nunca errou tava com pedra na mão
Gali vai carai filosofia arcaica sai da lama
E chama pra si a responsa dama ilude louca
Sonho com uma nação de pensadores
Onde todo mundo sabe que é igual
Ao invés disso somos
Capitalistas predadores e assassinos em potencial
Selva de pedra, coração de madeira
Paixão por perversa é querer arrumar pra cabeça
Esticar a raia pra sentir o coice da mula
Baby, lê a bula e vê se isso te faz bem
Meu baseado nunca fez mal pra ninguém, legaliza
Tira os menó do corre
Patrocínio do estado por trás da chacina
Também morre quem atira, karma é lei
Porque karma é lei e a justiça é divina

In the bathroom, on my back
There's a picture on the wall of Kanye West
He's staring at me, he's staring at me
I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out
I'm on the lawn, It's almost three
I look around, I look at her, she looks at me
She's suspicious, she's suspicious
I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out

[Chorus]
I feel fine, the best I've felt in quite a while
I feel fine, waited for this all my life
Save my soul, I swear I may never die
I feel fine, I'm freaking out, and I feel fine

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling fine
I found a flower, it's in my shoe and it is mine
Things are fine now, yeah it's alright
And all these god damn people in the world
They're all just getting by
I'm in the back room, she's with a guy
He's selling happiness and hopefulness
One bag at a time
I'm standing up, I'm sitting down
I'm freaking out, I'm freaking out


[Chorus]
I feel fine, the best I've felt in quite a while
I feel fine, waited for this all my life
Save my soul, I swear I may never die
I feel fine, I'm freaking out, and I feel fine

[Bridge]
I'm all alone, afraid of my life
I just want a home, wouldn't that be nice?
I'm all alone, afraid of my life
I just want a home, wouldn't that be nice?
I'm all alone, afraid of my life
I just want a home, wouldn't that be nice?

Back on that chain gang, strumming along
Hammering nails so I can sing my song
The Devil done this to me
I drive the spikes down profound
Building the cages that all broke us down
Boy, get back down on your knees

[Chorus]
So take these chains from me
We'll break these bastards, there's no masters here
In the end
We'll break these bastards, there's no masters here

[Verse 2]
A thousand boots down on the ground
Beating a drum under a marching sound
You better fucking believe
They're screaming left right, left right
Fist in the air, you better pick a side
Against the plutocracy

So take these chains from me
We'll break these bastards, there's no masters here
In the end
We'll break these bastards, there's no masters here


[Bridge]
Save the world
We never wanted, we never wanted
To save the world
We never wanted to have to save ourselves

We'll break these bastards, there's no masters here

[Letra de "Ya No Más"]

[Intro: Santiago Sáez]
Ohhh, na na na na

[Verse 1: Santiago Sáez]
Aquí sentí, viví, gané, perdí
De todos modos sigo andando, caminando
Amor fingí al decir que sí
Pero algo a mi me esta pasando
Me está gritando el corazón

[Pre-Chorus: Santiago Sáez]
No digas nada, déjame hablar
Tan solo llévate mis ganas de llorar

[Chorus: Santiago Sáez]
Vete, porque te puedo lastimar
Te digo vete, yo se mentir y se engañar
Insisto vete, no puedo cambiar
Vete, vete, vete
Ya no más
Ya no más

[Verse 2: Santiago Sáez, Pilar Pascual]
Aquí estas tú
Y yo pensando en ti
No se lo que está pasando
Pero esto no es normal
No se quien es el que hoy habla por mi
Pero no puedes evitarlo y se siente tan real


[Pre-Chorus: Santiago Sáez, Pilar Pascual]
No digas nada, déjame hablar
Tan solo llévate mis ganas de llorar

[Chorus: Santiago Sáez, Pilar Pascual]
Vete, porque te puedo lastimar
Te digo vete, si no te atreves a volar
Entonces vete, no puedo cambiar
Vete, vete, vete
Si no te atreves a soñar
Ya no más
Entonces vete
Mmm-hmm, Mr. Shakur, man, your essence remains pure

[Hook]
And by the freedom of God, we got a sure shot, and Jesus, you've been good to me
When it all stops, my life goes on for sure, Mr. Shakur and blessed with your
Presence, your essence remains pure

[Verse 1]
I never made it in school in '92, looking for a job as a part-time father, only
If you knew Pac, with the chronic through your music was getting me through, it's 1999
Now, what we gone do, huh, ya oh! enemies snicker when I pour out a
Little liquor, better not blaspheme your name and make you out to be the sinner
Who spent the holiday with that ghetto, cooking a hood dinner, writing my memoirs
Right next to your picture, remember: Life Goes On, that's what you told me
Homie, and Sylk-E-Fine hooked it up in the nick of time you know me-shit, I may be
Lonely and I talk to you, I hope you listening and we mob through you, we all miss
Him, and mommy say hey, she feed the babies, Johnny J still crazy as hell
Taking your class in college, hope I don't fail, I wish I had the mail for the
Million dollar bill, but that'd be too much like writing the whole situation
And it smells kind of fishy to me, bring the demons to the light, the truth-it
Might set me free, but they can't kill you twice, by the freedom of God we have
A sure shot, and Jesus you have been so good to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo, my friends ain't feeling me, tobacco companies make money off of killing me
We been waiting for forty acres like we said it, damn, and the earthquakes with
The world's retaliation, all the abomination, call it 'El Nino', but it feels
Like revelation, huh, and Pac they got to you, you don't think I think a fan shot
You, they was jealous of your jewellery, and the jury thought they got you, I
Fast, prepare for the rapture with a blast for the ghetto bastards, walk in the
Wilderness with God given talent for ashes, pass the pastor, he ain't helping
The hood like judges should, but life goes on, it's all good, and homie we
Fight for wood, to keep us stupid huh, and after Eazy, it ain't no more
Ruthless acoustics, same producers seduce us, with jewels to boost us, before
We prove em wrong, kinda revolutionary to move us, but life goes on
Within the music and the song, it's abusive if you use it to fuel your fire
Huh


[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Supporting my people, distorting my people, they calling my people, evil is finders keepers losers weep
The reaper, all you G's now, proposition 187, and you think we sleep now, how
In the new millennium could we smile, God loves the underdog, and of course the
Ghettos are close, just when the rain falls, reminisce on tattoos, the oceans
Pain y'all, note here for the dosage of prozac he prescribed, there's too much
Melanin in my system, musical group, we won't die, and what's the meaning of
Survival, knowledge of wealth is right there in your bible look at the literal
And learn yourself, pass me the lighter when I'm stressing on these issues, did
I mention my momma gonna need some tissue when they get you, I continue to flow
Eternal, remember Mo Murda way back in the day, smoking burners with lil Layzie
Man we shooting at the turtle, him and his big boyz dogging me out, I'm all alone
With my Thuggish Ruggish shirt on, but still many, I don't hate you, we black
And strong, even though I know right where you live, I forgive you and life goes on

[Hook]

[Instrumental Intro]
Intruder, identify yourself

[Verse 1: Casey Lee Williams &amp; Jeff Williams]
Born with no life
Into subjugation
Treated like a worthless animal
Stripped of all rights
Just a lesser being
Crushed by cruel, ruthless human rule

[Pre-Chorus 1: Casey Lee Williams]
When it started
All we wanted was a chance to live our lives
Now in darkness
Taking anything we want and we will rise
We'll rise, we'll rise

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams, Jeff Williams &amp; Both]
From shadows
We'll descend upon the world
Take back what you stole
From shadows
We'll reclaim our destiny
Set our future free
And we'll rise
And we'll rise


[Post-Chorus: Casey Lee Williams, Jeff Williams &amp; Both]
Above the darkness and the shame
Above the torture and the pain
Above the ridicule and hate
Above the binding of our fate

[Verse 2: Casey Lee Williams &amp; Jeff Williams]
Call us liars
Degenerates and killers
Psychos, heartless, insane criminals
Stupid mutts and
Nothing but pure evil
Primal bloodshed is all that's left to do

[Pre-Chorus 2: Casey Lee Williams]
We're misguided
Treated like we're criminals and we should hide
Born indicted
Tired of being pushed around and we will fly
We'll fly, we'll fly

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams &amp; Jeff Williams]
From shadows
We'll descend upon the world
From shadows
We'll reclaim our destiny


[Instrumental Outro]
This is hell
Welcome to hell
Our hell

It's time for you to drop dead
Dead to the ground (Dead to the ground)
Where we lay our bodies and bones
For you to take from us

Breaking them just to feel
What it’s like to see them kneel
I don't know, I don't know, what now?
So let them try to run
With everything thing that I have left for you to dread
Will you fall from the drop of nothing
Or will you pray for your death?

Weak lungs
I beg and beg with my last damn breath
Give me hope now
Sore eye
My vision blurs and my world's a slur
My fake reality lives
Disaster
Oblivious to our real problems
But you never thought that we would
End up helpless
Locked in chains for the things we thought
Would keep us safe from
Endless torture


Clock ticks but we're going backwards
Our enemy is our security

I've been here from the wreckage of nothing
I've been waiting for someone to save me
Stay alive (Just stay alive)
Stay alive

Blinded by the lights and deafened
By all of the siren noise
Smoke floods the sky
Our city burns down as the ashes fly
They try to scream (They try to scream)
There's more to life than countless drags
And spare change falling from your hands

You fight the truth within
When it’s buried underneath your
False accusations
Where’s the life of our generation?
I'm so sick of these twisted minds
I'm no better but, cut the lies
I'm not blind I see right through your eyes
True Identity, Unclassified!

Clock ticks but we’re going backwards
(You start the rage in me)
Our enemy is our security


I've been here from the wreckage of nothing
I've been waiting for someone to save me
Stay alive (Just stay alive)
Stay alive

With our hands
We gave the sign for the fallout
I raised this hand for you to follow me
It takes you time, when will you learn
This is your time for you to rest eternally
TRUE「Sincerely」の歌詞

「バース１」
知らない言葉を　覚えていくたび
おもかげのなか　手を伸ばすの
だけど一人では　分からない言葉も
あるのかもしれない

「ポストコーラス」
さよならは　苦くて
アイシテルは　遠いにおいがした
例えようのない　この想いは
とても怖くて　だけど　とても愛おしくて

「コーラス」
わたし　なんで　泣いているんだろう
心になんて　答えたらいい？
言葉はいつでも　語るでもなくて
そこにあるばかり　つのるばかり
わたしは　あなたに　会いたくなる

「バース２」
きれいな言葉を　覚えていくたび
自分のことが　嫌になりそう
だけど背を向けちゃ　いけない言葉も
あるのかもしれない


「ポストコーラス」
かなしみは　冷たく
ありがとうは　ぬくもりに色づく
形のないもの　触れるたびに
あなたの声が　胸のおくで　響いているの

「コーラス」
「器楽」

「ブリッジ」
書きかけてはやめた
あて先のない手紙は
風に揺れる
届けたい人の街まで
始まりの　終わりを　伝えるために

「フック」
生きること　やめないこと
あなたに　今日を　誇れるように

「コーラス」
わたし　なんで　泣いているんだろう
心になんて　答えたらいい？
言葉はいつでも　語るでもなくて
そこにあるばかり　つのるばかり
わたしは　あなたに　会いたくなるよ
[Текст песни "ШУМ В ГОЛОВЕ"]

[Куплет 1]
Я держу баланс во всём
Я даю вам джаз и чё
Кругом одна грязь из серых масс
Меры
Мясо, жирный басс
Вера
Нет, не нужен талант давно
Тебе нужен гарант? Смешно
Сунул свой шланг прям по гланд
Эра
Рэп-мутант ебет твой зад хером
Я плюнул, ты подними
Хочешь узнать мой мир?
Работай, работай, работай, работай, работай
Не за гроши
Музыка для души
Музыка смысл жить
Мне похуй на лохов, что пиздят там шепотом
Кем же стали мы
Так надо брать себя
В руки, чтобы надрать зад
Пруфы для тех, кто пиздят
Нубы хотят в глэм-отряд
Они прогорят
Им есть что терять
Я ублюдок, тот еще тонущий
Пора нырять


[Припев]
Шум в голове (шум в голове, шум в голове)
Шум в голове (шум в голове, шум в голове)
Шум в голове (шум в голове, шум в голове)
Шум в голове (шум в голове, шум в голове)

[Куплет 2]
Шум в голове, слышу только треск
Real talk, work work, нет времени на стресс
Шум в голове, потому что трезв
Смог, смог, всё в срок, да, это прогресс
Эй, оу, закрой свою пасть
В моей голове много дерьма
И мне на вас класть
Переведи на меня раз взгляд
Ты будешь распят
Говоришь не внятно
Я даю вам клятву
Пьяный корабль ко дну идёт
Да замарали все руки в кровь
Не потеряли честь, сердце рвёт
Сердце бьёт, в груди тесно, так честно

[Припев 2]
Шум в голове, ловлю радиоволны (у-у-у-у-у)
(Шум в голове, ловлю радиоволны)
Серые стены и люди и будни (у-у-у-у-у)
(Серые стены и люди и будни)
Шум в голове, ловлю радиоволны (у-у-у-у-у)
(Шум в голове, ловлю радиоволны)
Люди меняют бумажки на судьбы (у-у-у-у-у)
(Люди меняют бумажки на судьбы)

[Verse 1]
Look, as a kid I just wanted to fit in
So I did whatever the crowd did
And one day I asked this girl at school
That I thought was cute, "Ayy, what you listening to?"
She said, "I like everything, you know. Everything except country."
"Me too."
And I ain't never gave it a shot, but they said it was wack, so I figured it's true
Fast forward twenty years later
You might catch me bumping Kenny Rogers in the player
I got a little older, formed my own opinion
Stopped letting other people do my own thinking
Sometimes I wonder how many things I've passed by
And even passed judgement 'fore I gave it a try
So I keep an open mind, no exceptions
Man, I'm going country, I hope you get the message, yeah (Uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you heard this before: Rap is for the gangsters
Country's for the cowboys, R&amp;B is for the ladies, not true
If you don't know me, uh, you can't judge me, uh
They gon' love me when I pull up to this party

[Chorus]
Bumping country (Haha)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Why don't you give it a try? You might like country
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Why don't you give it a try? You might like country
Ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
I think you might like you some country (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
What if you end up liking?


[Verse 2]
Well, I grew up in a home
Where my father wasn't in the home
So once in a while, I'd visit on the weekend
My Italian side, and that's when I'd see him
Capiche? (Ha)
I remember speaking in detail
But only got football and females
A girlfriend? He asked if I had one
And if so, never bring home a Black one
"It must something wrong with them"
Well, that's what I thought back then
I wonder what his parents taught him
The irony is the closest thing I had to a dad was a black man
They say don't judge a book by its cover, and never judge a man by his skin
And never judge a song by its genre
Our hearts are the monsters that we should really fight against
But it seems like–

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you heard this before: Rap is for the gangsters
Country's for the cowboys, R&amp;B is for the ladies, not true
If you don't know me, uh, you can't judge me, uh
They gon' love me when I pull up to this party

[Chorus]
Bumping country
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Why don't you give it a try? You might like country
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Why don't you give it a try? You might like country
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I think you might like you some country
Ooh-ooh-ooh
What if you end up liking?


[Outro]
You might see me bumping Kenny Rogers in the player
Verse:
Hello, bonjour, konichiwa, hola, wassup!
Fellow hardcore offspring, we got no job but bust!
So come out to play, no need to be afraid, this beat is our prey
And after feasting leave the carcass up for display
I implore you to destroy two or more bars if that won't bore you
AfterTouch offered this blank canvas so here's the oil
Van Gogh hard in the paint for the Sunflower State til it's muddied in Kansas soil
Then wait a minute, let me get it. I'ma spit it like the middle west raised me
Blazing! Many want to get on this Fiya with a twist, but they end up with an orifice foaming; rabies
So the people think that's sick, because it don't click that the quickness got lifted
From the Midwest, best section in the whole wide, wide world. The fiasco was giving swine this pearl
Get off your soapbox. I can't be accessory to your faux pas
'Sposed to kill it from attic ceiling to finished basement the whole song
No nonsense, just the conscious art of bombing
Graffiti on tracks with locomotives that hip hop
Should I remind you that train of thought is played out
Same route been taken so long it's lame now
You need to turn up, autotune, trap out, and lean it over to the side
Triplet your homicide, flicking lyrics til they rhyme, fitting dimwits in a pine
Box that I'm out of
That undergroundling connected to you by that wireless router
Pinging the meanings of Jupiterans and you're in for abstract thinking
Bruising the losers; Black to purple; offensive and hurtful; Jinxing
Or is it Ditto if you Mr. Mime the same time
Or is it Brillo if you missed a line? My dang mind
Bends stupendously endlessly and I see entropy
Get the gist? I'm sick! (That Spitzophrenia!)
When is it my turn? The mic yearns for me. (No, it don't, homie)
(Had my eye on it, so when I lash, I master slave own it)
So give it to me, so we can be free; exploring passed norms and formal settings
(Are you kidding?) Hand it over! (No way!) STOP!
Or I'll be lodging it in your esophagus
Til you're oxygen-less and lobbing a fist after
(That, sir, is what the problem is: the answer isn't hyperviolent)
Keep your peace talks, my sniper's silent
You-you done-done messed-messed up-up now-now, I-I pro-pro-test-test
Ri-ri-ot-ot-ing-ing on-on wri-wri-ting-ting ain't-ain't best-best
One-one at-at a-a time-time per-per verse-verse
So-so re-re-sults-sults won't-won't be-be so-so per-per-verse-verse


Chorus:
That Spitzophrenia (repeated)

Threes!
My patience is running out
I want to say what I wanna say
Coming home from the bus stop at twilight
Saying bye bye bye to sad backs of others

You gotta show you Fighting Pose oh oh

A world like I have seen in my dreams
Without conflict, just daily peace
But in reality, I tend to worry about
Troubles and the daily grind
Those Rolling Days

Even though you keep on falling
You laugh and get up every time
As I board the vacant back of the bus
You flash me a small smile

I must place my trust in you

Sweet love like I have seen in my dream
Lovers searching for hidden refuge
But in reality, on the days we cannot meet
Continue on but I believe in Lonely Days

Oh yeah, yeah...
Even if you stumble, Way to go
Yeah, yay!
A muddled Rolling Star


It pains me so to see your smiling face, but
Is there no way to protect you till the end?

There is no meaning to this lie, none at all
All my loving
Without it, I can't go on

A world like I have seen in my dreams
Without conflict, just daily peace
But in reality, I tend to worry about
Troubles and the daily grind
Those Rolling Days

Oh yeah, yeah...
Even if you understand it all
Oh yeah, yeah...
Even if you stumble, way to go
Yeah yay
A muddled rolling star

Did you ever take the time to stop and think
Or imagine all the damage your words could cause?
It's now you're standing in front of a battle-scene
And one by one you're watching as hope is lost


Even though you can't undo all that you have done
It not too late to right all that you've done wrong
You only need to acknowledge the abysmal mind
And then you'll find the answers inside of you

Will you be my refuge
My haven in the storm
Will you keep the embers warm
When my fire’s all but gone?
Will you remember
And bring me sprigs of rosemary
Be my sanctuary
’Til I can carry on
Carry on
Carry on

This one knocked me to the ground
This one dropped me to my knees
I should have seen it coming
But it surprised me

Will you be my refuge
My haven in the storm
Will you keep the embers warm
When my fire’s all but gone?
Will you remember
And bring me sprigs of rosemary
Be my sanctuary
’Til I can carry on
Carry on
Carry on


In a state of true believers
On streets called us and them
Its gonna take some time
’Til the world feels safe again

Will you be my refuge
My haven in the storm
Will you keep the embers warm
When my fire’s all but gone?
Will you remember
And bring me sprigs of rosemary
Be my sanctuary
’Til I can carry on
Carry on
Carry on

You can rest here in Brown Chapel
Or with a circle of friends
Or quiet grove of trees
Or between two bookends

Will you be my refuge
My haven in the storm
Will you keep the embers warm
When my fire’s all but gone?
Will you remember
And bring me sprigs of rosemary
Be my sanctuary
’Til I can carry on
Carry on
Carry on
Will you be my refuge
My haven in the storm
Will you keep the embers warm
When my fire’s all but gone?
Will you remember
And bring me sprigs of rosemary
Be my sanctuary
’Til I can carry on
Carry on
Carry on

This one knocked me to the ground
This one dropped me to my knees
I should have seen it coming
But it surprised me

Will you be my refuge
My haven in the storm
Will you keep the embers warm
When my fire’s all but gone?
Will you remember
And bring me sprigs of rosemary
Be my sanctuary
’Til I can carry on
Carry on
Carry on


In a state of true believers
On streets called us and them
Its gonna take some time
’Til the world feels safe again

Will you be my refuge
My haven in the storm
Will you keep the embers warm
When my fire’s all but gone?
Will you remember
And bring me sprigs of rosemary
Be my sanctuary
’Til I can carry on
Carry on

You can rest here in Brown Chapel
Or with a circle of friends
Or quiet grove of trees

And bring me sprigs of rosemary

[Verse 1: Bad Seed]
I swear on my Yankee fitted, I'm 'bout business
Jesus, God, Muhammad, Allah, my witness
N.Y stand up, y'all know what this is (this is)
One for New York you bitches
Set the record straight, I rep the state
Everywhere I go the fitted attract hate
The N.Y logo, they say "Oh no!"
New York in the building, don't speed, go slow
Shout to westside, shout to south, shout to midwest
Overseas in depth, shout to everywhere I ain't even been yet
But when I touchdown one thing you can bet
I got my fitted on, who wanna get it on?
Even when I'm dolo, the borough and the logo
I'm so N.Y, oh and I, walk with a bop like my toes just died
The hat speak for me, I don't vocalize
Swing my arm like a hammer til I broke his eye
New York's on, yeah, and the pope get high
Yo pass my fitted, let me show this guy I
Got it in blue, got it in red I, got it in black, matter of fact
You could tell an N.Y nigga how he wear it
If it ain't about the fitted hat, I don't wanna hear it

[Hook]
That's my Yankee fitted, that's my Yankee fitted
That's my Yankee fitted, that's that Yankee (Hey!)
And everywhere we go, they already know
That's that Yankee fitted, that's my Yankee fitted
That's that Yankee... (Talib Kweli, Blacksmith!)


[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
My New Era Yankee fitted is so money
The way your hat fit on your head is so funny
You bummy, it's so laughable
I'm so international, I'm always on the runway no fashion show
Places I have to go, you can't get to it, no MetroCard
Wear it on stage and I sweat a lot, so you can tell I'm working
I got a reservoir of fitteds, 7 and 1/4th the fit is so perfect
I stay loyal to the royal blue
They call the Apple rotten cause New York City will spoil you
Sometimes I switch it up, with the fedora or the applejack, 'til I'm ready to bring the Apple back
That's when I open up my closet door, and find a cap to match the Spike Lee Jordans on the closet floor
Me and my fitteds travel many miles, before every tour I stop and try on the... ????

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MIMS]
I been around the world and I I I, I keeps my Yankee fitted
Brim tucked low across my eye's why, sometimes I can't see shit but yo
I go hard for my city no pause, me I ball like I have no draws
I had to pause on that, I sound reckless
I'm from New Yitty the city that found Precious
Yep yep, I rap hard when I'm OT, I got the game on wrap like I'm Roti
No seguro my nigga, that means no sleep
I hit the club like pussy meat and I'm so deep
I got a big ego, I make big bread
Ask these bitches they tell you I got a big head
That's cause most of y'all niggas ain't really livin'
You couldn't walk a day in my fitted, nigga you kiddin'?

この道に誓う 宿命の灯を絶やさない
想いという名の宝石があるから

どんなに速く走っても時には勝てない
新しいシューズじゃ まだ上手に歩けない
迷えばすぐ白と黒のカードを選んで
そんな風に割り切れる精神も持ってない

いいさシナリオはひとつじゃない
裏道めぐるのだって悪くない

朝靄に浮かぶまっすぐな道 逃さない
そこに丘があるから上ってく
重力に逆らう つま先に力込めて
明日という名のハードルがあるなら

先に行くと言葉残し 去ってゆく人
それぞれの背中には それぞれの汗の跡

急ぎ過ぎないでと止める声
足元すくう罠が見えなくて

真昼の月に映りこむ姿 隠せない
真実はいつも胸にあるから
交差点 引き抜かれた道しるべ探して
流した涙が教えてくれた


夕映えに 手のひらそっと突き上げて
命は果てないと 強く空(くう)を抱きしめた

夜の闇が歩むべき道を消してゆくなら
瞳閉じて 手探りで進もう
この道に誓う 宿命の灯を絶やさない
想いという名の宝石があるから
世界は終わりを告げようとしてる
誰にももう止められはしない
始まる
崩壊の交響曲が鳴り響いて
降る雨はまるで涙の音色

教えて

支配し支配され人達は
いつかその心に憎しみを
そして愛することを思い出せず
争うの?

この歌が聴こえてる
生命ある全ての者よ
真実はあなたの胸の中にある
嵐の海を行く時も
決して臆することのない強さを
くれるから

けれども進むほど風は強く
希望の灯はやがて消えていく
「明かりをよこせ」と奪い合い
果てに人は殺し合う
涙などとうに枯れて


気付いて

その目は互いを認めるため
その声は想いを伝えるため
その手は大事な人と繋ぐためにある

この歌が聴こえてる
世界中の寄る辺なき者よ
希望はあなたの胸の中にある
燃え盛る焔の中でも
決して傷つくことのない強さを
くれるから

その手で守ろうとしたものは
愛する者だったのだろうか
紅く染まったその手を眺めて
やっと自らがしてきた愚かさを
過ちと認めるその罪を
とめどなくあふれるその涙を知る

この歌が聴こえてる
生命ある全ての者よ
真実はあなたの胸の中にある
嵐の海は静まった
失ったものは数えきれなくとも


この歌が聴こえてる
世界中の寄る辺なき者よ
希望はあなたの胸の中にある
悲しみの夜を超える時
必ずあなたは生きていく強さを
持てるから
いつか見た夢
届かないつぶやきだけ
夜の光に包まれて彷徨い行く
やがて見開くその瞳　運命なら
せめて　そう、今だけ…

叶わないと俯(うつむ)く　夜風にただうなだれ
涙　月影　手の平に溢れてゆく
何が欲しいの？
唇は闇に震えていた

出逢ったあの時に胸突いた笑顔
護りたくて　ずっと崩れそうな約束を
痛み潰すほどに抱きしめてた

側に居れるだけで
同じ時間にいられるだけで
遠い記憶　蘇る悲しみも温めて行けるのに
廻り続けている思いに
安らぎ満ちた終わりは来るの？
繰り返した問い掛けは天に舞い
明けの空の　光に変わる

全て幻　浮かんではまた消えてく
邪念かき消す指先に絡み付いた無色の鎖
もがくほど孤独を編んでいた


断ち切られるように踵(きびす)かえす風
冷たすぎる今も「君がいるからだよ」と
闇に落ちた言葉　離れない

息をしてるだけで
同じ痛みを感じるだけで
ほんの少し幸せを積み上げる愛
気付いてしまった
凍えて肩寄せる瞳に
護りたいもの　見つかったから
次の夜明け　手にしてた後悔で錆びた欠片
光に変える

触れあうだけでその幸せを思っただけで
こみ上げてく
束の間のさよならも　消えぬ絆になると

側に居られるだけで
同じ時間にいられるだけで
遠い記憶　蘇る悲しみも温めて行けるのに
刻み込まれていた証(しるし)に
導かれまた倒れる時も
見つめ合った一瞬が千年の記憶を越え
光に変わる
いつか見た夢
届かないつぶやきだけ
夜の光に包まれて彷徨い行く
やがて見開くその瞳　運命なら
せめて　そう、今だけ…

叶わないと俯(うつむ)く　夜風にただうなだれ
涙　月影　手の平に溢れてゆく
何が欲しいの？
唇は闇に震えていた

出逢ったあの時に胸突いた笑顔
護りたくて　ずっと崩れそうな約束を
痛み潰すほどに抱きしめてた

[Instrumental Intro]
Intruder, identify yourself

[Verse 1: Casey Lee Williams &amp; Jeff Williams]
Born with no life
Into subjugation
Treated like a worthless animal
Stripped of all rights
Just a lesser being
Crushed by cruel, ruthless human rule

[Pre-Chorus 1: Casey Lee Williams]
When it started
All we wanted was a chance to live our lives
Now in darkness
Taking anything we want and we will rise
We'll rise, we'll rise

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams, Jeff Williams &amp; Both]
From shadows
We'll descend upon the world
Take back what you stole
From shadows
We'll reclaim our destiny
Set our future free
And we'll rise
And we'll rise


[Post-Chorus: Casey Lee Williams, Jeff Williams &amp; Both]
Above the darkness and the shame
Above the torture and the pain
Above the ridicule and hate
Above the binding of our fate

[Verse 2: Casey Lee Williams &amp; Jeff Williams]
Call us liars
Degenerates and killers
Psychos, heartless, insane criminals
Stupid mutts and
Nothing but pure evil
Primal bloodshed is all that's left to do

[Pre-Chorus 2: Casey Lee Williams]
We're misguided
Treated like we're criminals and we should hide
Born indicted
Tired of being pushed around and we will fly
We'll fly, we'll fly

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams &amp; Jeff Williams]
From shadows
We'll descend upon the world
From shadows
We'll reclaim our destiny


[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse]
I gave her everything
She took my heart and left me lonely
I think broken heart's contagious
I won't fix, I'd rather weep
I'm lost then I'm found
But it's torture bein' in love
I love when you're around
But I fuckin' hate when you leave

[Chorus]
Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide if you're ever gonna let me know (Yeah)
Suicide if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah

Send them hollows through your head and leave your brains flushed-

[Intro]
I don't like you, T-Series
Nothing personal, kid
But I must go all out
Just this once

[Verse 1]
Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
Sit the fuck down, T-Series, I'm here to spill the real tea (Uh)
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
But you India you lose, so best think you haven't won
When I'm through with you we're gonna be completely fuckin' done
'Cause we only just begun, I review you: *clap clap*
Zero, bye bitch, gone
So come on T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna

[Chorus]
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just crying for their mama
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series just wet themselves in their pajamas


[Verse 2]
So who the hell is Bob and why you wanna kiss him? (Ew)
I'm a Blue-Eyes White Dragon while you're just Dark Magician (Oof)
You got a fifth of the population in your nation, but
I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (Oops)
Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
Your language sounds like it comes from a mumble rap community
No papa, no papa, yes papa; Johny
Now down all of this sugar and let's throw this fuckin' party with some—

[Chorus]
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they're just crying for their mama
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just wetting their pajamas
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna

[Outro]
You got a population of one point three-two billion
But most your videos can't seem to hit even a million
Sub-bot!
[Intro: Lil Wayne]
No homo
I say, he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
Remix, baby!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
"How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?"
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell her, "Girl, like Doritos, that's not yo cheese"
Tell her friends, "Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay"
I can't only have one and I ain't tryin' to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gonna melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need oh-oh-oh-oh!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two-seats, and you out of bounds
So come here, baby girl
You're now fuckin' with the best in the world
Lollipop, the best in the world


[Chorus: Static Major]
She lick me like a lollipop
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shawty say she wanna lick the wrapper
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flickin' actor
I Anita Bake her, now she caught up in the Rapture
I got so much chips I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy motha-fudge cake, now tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake, soo-woo, think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin, Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment
With Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it


[Chorus: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feelin' of me bein' the shit
'Cause I was leavin' skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere: innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD thing, tape deck
IPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that "I think I'm late" text
So wrap it up!
But he's so sweet she wanna lick the wrapper

[Chorus: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

[Verse 2]
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it


[Pre-Chorus 2]
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

[Bridge]
(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh, give you up)
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)

[Verse 2]
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it


[Pre-Chorus 1]
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
[Verse 1]
Blank stares, faithless
Vampires at the same places
Shadows, traces
I know that you feel me

[Refrain]
You're runnin’, runnin', runnin', runnin’
Making the rounds with all your fake friends
Runnin', runnin' away from it
You can strip down without showing skin, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're hoping, you're not hopeless
So why can't you show me?
Why can't you show me?
I can see you’re looking for distractions
I can see you’re tired of the acting
So why can't you show me?

[Chorus]
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it’s 3AM and you're all alone
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (I, I, I)
Who are you in the dark?


[Verse 2]
Plus one, guest list
But you don't even know what her name is
Secrets, endless
I know that you feel me

[Refrain]
You’re runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' (oh)
Making the rounds with all your fake friends (making)
Runnin', runnin' away from it (away)
You can strip down without showing skin, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're hoping, you're not hopeless
So why can't you show me?
Why can't you show me?
I can see you're looking for distractions
I can see you're tired of the acting
So why can't you show me?

[Chorus]
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it's 3AM and you're all alone
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (I, I, I)
Who are you in the dark?


[Bridge]
Darling, come on and let me in
Darling, all of the strangers are gone, they're gone
I said, darling, come on and let me see
Darling, I promise that I won't run

[Chorus]
So tell me
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)
Show me the scary parts (I, I)
Who are you when it's 3 AM
And you're all alone (and you're all alone)
And L.A. doesn't feel like home? (No, I, I, I)
Who are you in the dark?

[Outro]
Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?
Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?
Mmmmm, mmmm, mmm
Who are you in the dark?

Hey there lonely one
Did you think you’d die alone?
I don’t think you want to know
Hey there lonely one
When you try to leave the world this way
You’re not the only one that goes

But you say so long
‘Cause you’re too far gone to waste away
Long enough to call home

Stealing life’s a way to go alone
Stealing life’s a way to move along
‘Cause you’re too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on

Bye Bye lonely one
What was it that you wanted to say?
You’ve gone and thrown your life away
And now the lonely one
I wish he’d read the notes inside his head
But I don’t think I’d want to know

But you say so long
‘Cause you’re too far gone to waste away
Long enough to call home


Stealing life’s a way to go alone
Stealing life’s a way to move along
‘Cause you’re too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on

Bye Bye lonely one
What was it that you wanted to say
Waste away
Long enough to call home

Stealing life’s a way to carry on
Stealing life’s a way to go alone
Stealing life’s a way to move along
‘Cause you’re too far gone
You won't be there to help us carry on
To help us carry on
To help us carry on
To help us carry on
You are too far-gone to help us carry on
[Intro: Nessly]
Daytrip took it to 10 (Hey)

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Nas X]
I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold


[Refrain: Lil Nas X &amp; Cardi B]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought (Cardi)

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, gunshot, gunshot
Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last nigga did me dirty, dirty
Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop
Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow
That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is Snapped
Now you know how I get, every day, a foreign whip
Rather see you in a hearse than see you with some other bitch
Huh?

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought


[Outro: Lil Nas X]
I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you
Letra de "O Funil", por Tribo da Periferia &amp; Fidalgo

[Refrão: Duckjay]
Oh, Oh
Enquanto esse céu não se abriu (é nóis)
De jaqueta de couro com frio (é nóis)
Lupa polarizada e quem viu (é nóis)
De Tiptronic na rua sumiu
O que é preciso pra passar do funil
Não é Taurus HC Plus, nike não nem fuzil (é não)
Ela sorriu quando a fumaça subiu são poucos que compreendem mais o corre fluiu

[Ponte: Duckjay]
Chinelo de dedo no Hyundai só o mel
Com certas daninha amadeus de papel
Atiça que elas vem maryjane no véu, Kamika-Z no comando
Marginal bacharel

[Verso 1: Duckjay]
Um brinde pra quem corre nego a hora é agora
A vida é pra sorrir nessa porra e fazer história
Só estorar champanhe não adianta se não tem glória
Quanto mais olha pra trás mais longe fica da vitória (é nóis)
E não precisa ser Chandon agilize
Tudo fica chique se o clima é bom
As cores do batom
As luzes do neon
Tá massa


[Refrão: Duckjay]
Oh
Enquanto esse céu não se abriu (é nóis)
De jaqueta de couro com frio (é nóis)
Lupa polarizada e quem viu (é nóis)
De Tiptronic na rua sumiu

[Verso 2: Fidalgo]
Ontem, de pé no chão hoje flutuar
Antes, pra sorrir era sonhar
Hoje, o que quiser é só batalhar (bora)
Não é o que? Ham? Me dá (pra)
Foi só viver o sonho a cobra voou
Ó só, esses menino virou predador
Que dó, de lá pra cá nem pardau pio
Mas o barro e o asfalto é o mesmo valor
Então ergue essas vela ao vento leste
Outro nascer do sol lá pros pivete
Memo se o barco virar marujo segue
Amar é tédio, risco e a gente cede
Acende um, medita na vitória
Os desacreditados se tornaram agora
Sorri, sozinho lembrando dessa história
Se é pra contar na roda
Calibra essas taça agora (wow)
Quanta memória
Vale cada sorriso, cada lágrima que brota
É emociona saber que isso não tem volta
Mas se tivesse volta faria tudo ser como agora (vai)


[Refrão: Duckjay]
Enquanto esse céu não se abriu (é nóis)
De jaqueta de couro com frio (é nóis)
Lupa polarizada e quem viu (é nóis)
De Tiptronic na rua sumiu (é nóis)
[Verso 1: Duckjay]
Cidades se acende
E eu, não quero dormir também
E o tempo, não dá tempo pra ninguém
Amores são provisórios, eternos são ilusórios
E a prioridade é viver bem

Erga as mãos, as taças
Tudo passa ligeiro
Quer fazer então faça, eles vão falar mal do mesmo jeito
Viver sem segredo
Sempre viver sem segredo
Bom é viver sem segredo

[Refrão: Duckjay]
Sem provar pra ninguém
Sem olhar pra trás
Hoje eu vou curtir igual ninguém nunca vai
Tudo vai ficar bem, pra esquecer nunca mais
Hoje eu vou curtir igual ninguém nunca vai

Vamos virar Lenda!
Vamos virar Lenda!
Vamos virar Lenda!
Vamos virar Lenda!
Vamos virar Lenda!


[Pré-Verso 2: Duckjay]
Talvez essa fase é orgulho
Conteúdo pra história
Quem entra pra sair no lucro, nunca vai ficar na memória

[Verso 2: Look]
Bora pra pista que eu viro o jogo
Cola comigo e cê vale ouro
Hoje vivo sem segredo
E sei que a lei do retorno é em dobro
Não deixe à vontade lá fora
Não!
Quando sua fé for de outro nível
Passar por incrível fazendo história

[Refrão: Duckjay]
Sem provar pra ninguém
Sem olhar pra trás
Hoje eu vou curtir igual ninguém nunca vai
Tudo vai ficar bem, pra esquecer nunca mais
Hoje eu vou curtir igual ninguém nunca vai

Vamos virar Lenda!
Vamos virar Lenda!
Vamos virar Lenda!
Vamos virar Lenda!
Vamos virar Lenda!


[Verso 3: Duckjay]
Vim causar dúvidas por umas noites
Mas qual a gang mais louca do frevo hoje?
Às vezes odiado, às vezes mal amado
Pois ser humano é fraco, mentiroso e falho
Sou o universo em crise, alheios admiram
Sou desses que revive, quando ocasiões conspiram
Sou o retrato onde moro
Só seguir o enredo
Vou viver esse segredo

[Refrão: Duckjay]
Sem provar pra ninguém
Sem olhar pra trás
Hoje eu vou curtir igual ninguém nunca vai
Tudo vai ficar bem, pra esquecer nunca mais
Hoje eu vou curtir igual ninguém nunca vai

Vamos virar lenda!
Vamos virar lenda!
Vamos virar lenda!
Vamos virar lenda!
Vamos virar lenda!

Eso e' lo má' que le gusta de mí

[Bridge: KAROL G &amp; Pop Smoke]
Soltera anda como Rihanna (Rihanna)
Aunque con él se viene (Ey)
Todo' quieren una colombiana (Sí)
Pero él ya la tiene
Está soltera, anda como Rihanna (Ey)
Aunque con él se viene (Yeah)
Todo' quieren una colombiana (Sí)
Pero él ya la tiene (Look, look)


[Chorus: Pop Smoke &amp; KAROL G, Both]
You don't gotta put your cup down, hold on
Drink freely (Yeah) and holla at me if you need me
Baby, you should enjoy yourself
Bossed up, need no help, look
They say, "Fly girls have more fun" (More fun, more fun)
So what? So you should enjoy yourself, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
You should enjoy yourself

[Outro: Pop Smoke &amp; KAROL G]
I won't kiss and tell
Just buy you Chanel
Always roll you up, put H's on your belt
Uh-huh, uh-uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-uh-huh
O you took my word and you took my key
You took my pride and you took my dignity
How can I still pretend
To be what a man should be

Well, whatever I say is in a book
Whatever I do there's someone there to look
You just can't shake a man
The way that I've been shook

Now is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory

O see that lifer doing his time
If I could have his place and he'd have mine
We'd be no better off
On either side of the line

Well, you took my job and you put me to sleep
You feed me money, you treat me like a creep
Wish I could get away
But I must be in it too deep


Tell me is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory

Well, you tell me you're going to get in touch
You send me a letter that reads like double-Dutch
You say, you're bound to lose
You're a little such-and-such

You got my number, you got my rank
You drained my head, you drained my petrol tank
And when I die of shame
I won't even know who to thank

Now, now, is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
[Intro]
Hé mais pourquoi quand t'es petit que c'est l'heure de goûter et qu'on te donne un gâteau, t'es tellement content que tu danses tout seul ? Et pendant que tu manges tu fredonnes une chanson qui n'existe pas !
(J'ai un gâteau) Quel est le projet ? (J'ai un gâteau et pas toi !)

[Couplet 1]
J'ai déjà pensé à m'auto-dead, c'était pas une good idea
Bah non, vous saviez pas ? Comment ça ? Qui vous l'a dit ?
Grâce à Dieu, j'me suis auto-raisonné
Mon cœur a cherché et Tolstoï a résonné
Pourtant, j'étais désœuvré, les problèmes je les résolvais
Mais à dire vrai, les lovés qu'on me voulait, j'pouvais pas les trouver
J'allais pas voler les lovés d'un autre comme un vieux you-voi
Celui que je vouvoie, voit tout, donc il allait tout voir
J'me suis auto-stoppé, j'ai fait de l'auto-psy
J'me suis auto-soigné et "Lord Have Mercy"
On se disait "Encore des pâtes ce mois-ci !"
Mais crois-moi c'est mieux qu'un cramoisi, plat moisi
Quand je regarde tout ça, maintenant je lâche des auto-YES !!!
Parfois je danse tout seul, je fais de l'auto-dance
Admettons que je sois fou, à moi tout seul, j'suis une foule en liesse
En gros, le concept : je pratique l'auto-dance

[Refrain]
Et je danse tout seul (x4)
Je fais de l'auto-dance (x4)
Je suis tout seul chez moi, je lâche des petits pas
Et je danse tout seul (x2)
Je fais de l'auto-dance (x4)


[Couplet 2]
Je pratique l'auto-dance comme un joueur de foot
C'est mieux que les actes manqués, quand tu t'auto-loupes
Ou quand tu te fakhastalou, quand tu t'auto-croûtes
Trop s'auto-ghetto, comme les ghetto youth
Fut une période, j'me faisais auto-pitié
J'ai mis ma vie sur la table et l'avenir m'a fait du pied
Autodidacte, j'ai fait mon auto-école
Ce que tu auto-sèmes, tu l'auto-récoltes
Et si tu t'auto-bloques, en fait, tu t'auto-ségrègues
Si tu te dis que c'est pas pour toi, tu t'auto-apartheid
Il faut parier sur soi, faire un auto-loto
Savoir s'écouter, se faire une auto-radio
Avec leur smart phones, ils se font des auto-photos
Je suis gardien de mon image, je suis un photomaton
Admettons que je sois fou, à moi tout seul, je suis une foule en liesse
En gros, le concept, je pratique l'auto-dance

[Refrain]
Et je danse tout seul (x4)
Je fais de l'auto-dance (x4)
Et je danse tout seul (x4)
Je suis là, tout seul chez moi
Et je danse tout seul (x3)
Je fais de l'auto-dance (x4)
Et je danse tout seul (x4)


[Outro]
Et venez, on danse tous tout seul, tous ensemble
Chacun dans son coin, tous dans la même pièce
Yeah

[Refrain]
Et on danse tout seul (x4)
On fait de l'auto-dance (x4)
Et on danse tout seul (x4)

Et elle danse toute seule
[Verse 1]
He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

[Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

[Chorus]
But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return


[Pre-Chorus]
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

[Chorus]
But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all
All day
Always
I have to go somewhere

All day
Always
I have to go somewhere

Hello, halo
Hello, halo
I'll walk away
I'll walk away
Hello, halo
Hello, halo
I'll walk away
I'll walk away
All day
Always
I have to go somewhere

[Guitar solo]

All day (Hello, halo)
Always (I'll walk away)
I have to go somewhere (I'll walk away)
I'll walk away


All day (Hello, halo)
Always (I'll walk away)
I have to go somewhere (Hello, halo)
I'll walk away
I'll walk away
All day
[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Try to tell you, tell you
I'm choking on my heartbeat
Every time I hear your voice
I'm more than shy, I'm paralyzed

[Pre-Chorus]
I can spit sixteen bars
Of tongue twisters without
Stutterin', stumblin', droppin' out
But I cannot speak
When you're around

[Chorus]
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
Yeah


[Verse 2]
And I love the way
I love the way we lose
I'm more than shy, I'm paralyzed

[Pre-Chorus]
I can spit sixteen bars
Of tongue twisters without
Stutterin', stumblin', droppin' out
But I cannot speak
When you're around

[Chorus]
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
Yeah

[Bridge]
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak (But I cannot speak)
When you're around


[Chorus]
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak (I cannot speak)
When you're around (When you're around)

[Outro]
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around


[Verse 1]
This romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

[Verse 2]
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time


[Chorus]
Yeah, I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

[Bridge]
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

[Guitar Solo]

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

[Verse 1]
Far away, as far as the eye can see
Is a place that I don't understand
A place we know as Sonderland
I call it home, call it hell
I'm sure if it could it would call me names as well
Like "a walking detriment"
On the world's worst carousel

[Pre-Chorus]
These strange times that we live in
Will slowly eat you alive if you don't fit in

[Chorus]
Welcome to my dark despair
Everyone here is a nightmare
As they all keep talking in their sleep
I am wondering
If it surely gets better than this

[Verse 2]
Why do good things come to all those terrible people?
And would God be the next big thing
If you heard her on the radio?
Where did all the good ones go?
They finish last or they die young
Then it's onto the next post
The story of a generation
So dead set on novelty
But some honesty now and then would be quite nice


[Chorus]
Welcome to my dark despair
Everyone here is a nightmare
As they all keep talking in their sleep
I am wondering
If it surely gets better than this

[Bridge]
No, I don't want wanna sit and talk about politics
Or social sciences in contradiction
Not when I'm staring down the edge of the precipice
With grim ambition

[Pre-Chorus]
These strange times that we live in
Will slowly eat you alive if you don't fit in

[Chorus]
Welcome to my dark despair
Everyone here is a nightmare
As they all keep talking in their sleep
I am wondering
If it surely gets better than this

[Outro]
Surely gets better than this
It surely gets better than this
It surely gets better than this

[Verse 1]
I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus]
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

[Verse 2]
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just want to stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever


[Chorus]
I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't want to miss a thing

[Bridge]
I don't want to miss one smile
I don't want to miss one kiss
Well, I just want to be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just want to hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Don't want to close my eyes
Don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't want to miss a thing


[Chorus]
I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, baby
And I don't want to miss a thing

[Outro]
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep, yeah
I don't want to miss a thing
[Verse 1]
Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Verse 2]
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch


[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

[Bridge]
A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

[Chorus]
Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots
Got a little dirt on my boots

Aaron

[Chorus (Condensed)]
I can’t forgive him or myself
“Na zdrowie!” Pour it out for health
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck, I got stories to tell

[Verse 1]
They called my dad a creeper when they stripped me away from him
On sad days I believed them, dirt on the name of Steven
Teenage cuts, cuts that ain’t stopped bleeding
To feel is fuckin' freedom, I got my Eastern Dreamin
Swimmin', he’s a fiend, chances are he’ll make a scene
There he goes again, rude cunt, real cunt
(Yah) Mongrel blood is deeper, drownin' with no culture
Some boys think they’re predators when they’re really vultures
Hell is bubblin’ over, tell me can you smell the sulfur?
Take another toke and melt into the sofa
You need a bad man to keep the bad men at the door
Only God is keeping score, I’m Madonna and the whore
And they keep on wanting more and I keep on letting blood
Even though I gave it all, mind’s racing back and forth
Shoulda fuckin' took that call, reaper man was at his door
And when he died his heart was sore


[Chorus]
I can’t forgive him or myself
“Na zdrowie!” Pour it out for health
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck, I got stories to tell
I can’t forgive him or myself
“Na zdrowie!” Pour it out for health
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck, I got stories to tell, I got stories...

[Verse 2]
These country kids are spittin' as they’re calling me a freak
But I’m on a winning spree, despite of my pedigree
Always thought I was better, my momma calls me judgemental
Thats why I’m not sentimental
And the past I have left it behind
But the guilt it is still on my mind
At the funeral I couldn’t cry
I rap this shit with tears in my eyes (Yah)
I find it hard to sleep, cunt
I’m thinking of some whack shit
The demons of the past are always fuckin' in the back seat
Sugar cane and bad heat
Mosquito bites and dank weed
The kids that once harassed me
Will never fucking pass me
Red dust in the rear view, I can’t fucking see you
I got a bad man, he keeps the bad man at the door
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, mother fuck the law
Bubba grew up poor, that's why I want it all


[Chorus (Extended)]
I can’t forgive him or myself
“Na zdrowie!” Pour it out for health
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck, I got stories to tell
And I can’t forgive him or myself
“Na zdrowie!” Pour it out for health
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck, I got stories to tell, I got stories...
Can’t forgive him or myself
“Na zdrowie!” Pour it out for health
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck, I got stories to tell
And I can’t forgive him or myself
“Na zdrowie!” Pour it out for health
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck, I got stories to tell, I got stories...
[Verse 1]
I miss that look in your eye
How your body felt on mine
Remember everything
I remember everything
I'm saying sorry again
'Cause it's you I can't forget
There's something more to this
I know there's something more to this

[Chorus]
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open? Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you

[Verse 2]
I miss the taste of your lips
Feeling your breath on my skin
Remember everything
I remember everything
I hope one day things can change
'Cause you're worth all of the pain
I keep on holding on
I just keep on holding on


[Chorus]
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open? Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you

[Bridge]
Somebody save me
I feel like I'm on my own
Even when I'm alone with you
Somebody save me
When you hold me in your arms
I don't know if I belong with you

[Chorus]
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open? Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open? Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you
[Verse 1]
I miss that look in your eye
How your body felt on mine
Remember everything
I remember everything
I'm saying sorry again
'Cause it's you I can't forget
There's something more to this
I know there's something more to this

[Chorus]
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open? Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you

[Verse 2]
I miss the taste of your lips
Feeling your breath on my skin
Remember everything
I remember everything
I hope one day things can change
'Cause you're worth all of the pain
I keep on holding on
I just keep on holding on


[Chorus]
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open? Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you

[Bridge]
Somebody save me
I feel like I'm on my own
Even when I'm alone with you
Somebody save me
When you hold me in your arms
I don't know if I belong with you

[Chorus]
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open? Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Would you tear your heart open? Tell me the truth
Would you bleed for me like I bleed for you?
Even if I was broken, broken like you
[Intro]
How can I feel? How can I feel?
How can I feel? How can I feel?
How can I feel? How can I feel?

[Chorus]
How can I feel when my blood has run dry?
How can I feel to never see the sunrise?
Bleed for me bitch, bleed for me bitch
Bleed for me bitch, bleed for me bitch
How can I feel when my blood has run dry?
How can I feel to never see the sunrise?
Bleed for me bitch, bleed for me bitch
Bleed for me bitch, bleed for me bitch

[Verse]
Eternally recurring
My hearts burnt out
I'm done yearning for better days
Roll my darkness up let it blaze
This ain't a phase
Razor blade cuts deep
I can't, feel, nothing, any, more

[Chorus]
How can I feel when my blood has run dry?
How can I feel to never see the sunrise?
Bleed for me bitch, bleed for me bitch
Bleed for me bitch, bleed for me bitch
How can I feel when my blood has run dry?
How can I feel to never see the sunrise?
Bleed for me bitch, bleed for me bitch
Bleed for me bitch, bleed for me bitch

Annabelle
We're both going to hell
You're gonna love the clientele
Cheap rent and the climate's swell
Annabelle
I've been drunk since half past twelve
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

[Pre-Chorus]
The world, it seems
To be ending constantly
Between the smoke and drink and getting high
I'd shed a tear if I could find the time, oh

[Chorus]
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) God can't save us
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) So let's live like sinners
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
My reassurances; it's not that bad
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) You gotta live a little when the world just wants you sad

[Verse 2]
Annabelle
Where the forbidden dwell
Come lay me down
Come lay me down


[Pre-Chorus]
The world, it seems
To be ending constantly
Between the smoke and drink and getting high
I'd shed a tear if I could find the time, oh

[Chorus]
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) God can't save us
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) So let's live like sinners
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
My reassurances; it's not that bad
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) You gotta live a little when the world just wants you sad

[Bridge]
The heavens are open
The angels descending
God bless you, undress you
And this unhappy ending
The underworld kids
Of the choir will sing
Hallelujah!
"God has left the building"

[Chorus]
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) (God can't save us)
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) (So let's live like sinners)
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
My reassurances; it's not that bad
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) You gotta live a little when the world just wants you sad
[Intro:]
Ich glaube, sie waren jetzt in jedem erdenklichen Beruf tätig. Sie sind immer kläglich gescheitert. Ja, ich frage mich manchmal, ob sie sich mit Absicht so blöd anstell'n. Und trotzdem fang' sie immer wieder was neues an. Was versprechen sie sich davon?

[Verse 1]
Ja, ich weiß, ich war Englischlehrer, Gespensterjäger
Entertainer, Sänftenträger
Ich war Judokämpfer, U-Boot-Lenker
Fluglotsenarzt, Stuhlgroßhändler
Empfangsdamencaster, äh, Tankwagenfahrer
Landkartenmaler, Anglerberater, klar
Beim Militär Gerichtsmediziner, Angela Merkels dritter Geliebter
Landesverkehrsminister von China
Tanzende-Bären-im-Schritt-Tätowierer, Bitch
Alles ist schiefgegangen, doch das war genau so Plan
Also wieder mit dem Fahrrad auf die Autobahn
Als Frauenschwarm brauchst du Erfahrung, los, erfahre
Verletzte Kinder kriegen eher Schokolade

[Bridge]
Mir fehlen ein paar Daumen, aus dem Thema wird ein Buch
Ein Speer in meinem Unterleib, ich werde interviewt
Mein Kopf trägt eine Reifenspur, das Mädchen hört mir zu

[Refrain]
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben, yeah


[Verse 2]
Ich war Brettspielschreiner, Taxi Driver
Jet Lis Meister, Abschleppdienstleiter
Webdesigner, Steckbriefschreiber
Pepsi-Light-Verkäufer, Drecksviehtreiber
Extremsportler, Seelsorger, AIDS-Forscher, Reporter
Skateboarder, Seefahrer, Gay Porn Star
Computerspiele-Tester, Schulkantinenbäcker, Flugmaschinenchef
Gesuchter Kriegsverbrecher, Buchkapiteltexter
Immer direkt gefeuert oder von den Cheffen verhau'n
Ich nehm' das lächelnd in Kauf, denn meine Rechnung geht auf-
Einmal zeigt sie mir Int'resse
Jede Wunde ist 'ne Story, also weiter Scherben essen

[Bridge]
Mir fehlen ein paar Daumen, aus dem Thema wird ein Buch
Ein Speer in meinem Unterleib, ich werde interviewt
Mein Kopf trägt eine Reifenspur, das Mädchen hört mir zu

[Refrain]
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben, yeah

[Verse 3]
Und ich steuere den Flieger, alle finden den Tod
Du bist ein blinder Passagier, ich bin ein blinder Pilot
Ich werd gerufen: "Herr Doktor, ich merk' meine Beine nicht!"
Ich sage nichts - ärztliche Schweigepflicht
Und nochmal, alle finden den Tod
Du bist ein blinder Passagier, ich bin ein blinder Pilot
Ich werd gerufen: "Herr Doktor, ich merk' meine Beine nicht!"
Ich sage nichts - ärztliche Schweigepflicht


"Sie sind gefeueeert!" Schade... Hahaha...

[Bridge]
Mir fehlen ein paar Daumen, aus dem Thema wird ein Buch
Ein Speer in meinem Unterleib, ich werde interviewt
Mein Kopf trägt eine Reifenspur, das Mädchen hört mir zu

[Refrain]
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du Narben
Willst du sie haben, dann brauchst du... yeah... Narben
[Verse 1: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the shadows where darkness crawls
And the spiderwebs between it all
We are the slither underneath your feet
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 2: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the pain of the rotten tooth
Of every child with hallow loot
We are the snake in your kitten's tree
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 3: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
Some with horns and some with fangs
A hundred eyes and giant brains
From the depths of the cosmic sea
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 4: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the fly in your baby food
Monsters of the foulest mood
We haunt every house and dream
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Chorus: MC God]
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight‚ I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God‚ she got them big ass titties‚ she's only five (Ayy, ayy)
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight‚ I just really wanna pipe

[Verse 1: MC Prophet]
Bitch, I'm boutta fuck this cutie so I whip out my katana
And I knock this lil' bitch out with just one hit like I'm Saitama
Why you act like you retarded? Like lil' bitch, I don't want drama
I still hit when she says "No," don't understand when she don't wanna, ayy
Sword fighting with my penis like I'm in a fuckin' dojo
All these bitches want me like my name was fuckin' JoJo
Asian penis is too tiny like it was a no show
Bitch don't want your coochie, watch anime with the bros though


[Verse 2: Wonder]
Sailor Moon my motherfucking bitch
I might pull up, give those thighs a little motherfucking kiss
And, man, if you talking shit tell Ryuk you on the list
Yeah, your sister is my groupie, she take this anime dick
Okay, okay, like little bitch, I don't care if that fat ass is 2D
Score a bounty on that pussy, you can call me Spike Lee
Puttin' out fire, gettin' ice, bitch, I'm Todoroki
And if you got some shit to say then you can say it to me

[Chorus: MC God]
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight, I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God, she got them big ass titties, she's only five (Ayy, ayy)
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight, I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God, she got them big ass titties, she's only five (Ayy, ayy)

[Verse 3: MC Prophet]
Asuna, Asuna, Mikasa, please
Can you just give me head? Please, just get on your knees
Bitch, I'll beat up that ass like my name is Bruce Lee
And I'll eat up that pussy like I'm Kaneki, ayy
Asian people driving, are they even trying?
I be buying all this hentai so I jerk it, I'm not lying
Now I'm sighing 'cause I want Hatsune Miku, now I'm crying
When I fuck anime bitches I'll be moaning and be whining, ayy


[Bridge: MC Prophet]
Thick thighs look sexy even when especially she decides to wear her dress
Uwu, nuzzles on my neck
Now we layin' on the bed
Man, I love my body pillow especially givin' head
You know what’s next

[Chorus: MC God]
Anime thighs when she open up so wide, I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight, I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God, she got them big ass titties, she's only five

[Outro]
Tehehehehe, that was gay
I can’t breathe
I’m falling
I can’t see
I’m climbing
I can’t be
I’m sorry
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
For me

Heart to heart it hits but you will never know
My noble dark angel in the blood red snow
I’ve bled, I’ve burnt
Laid in the dirt
Hands up my skirt
The devil sows and I reap the hurt

Shown you all I have to show
Laid out my soul
They still want more
I’ve said my piece down on my knees
I spoke a prayer for my enemies

I can’t breathe
I’m falling
I can’t see
I’m climbing
I can’t be
I’m sorry
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
For me
[Intro]
Run away
In fear of me dying today

[Chorus]
Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days

[Verse 1]
Chip, chip, cheerio, everything's all good, right?
I got rich, I got rich, I'm livin' that fast life
Couple M's in my bank account, I got cash, right?
And that's supposed to make me happy
I got a couple questions
How come that shit don't ever make me happy?
Money give me an erection
But that don't mean it's gon' be everlasting
Yeah, I know it's a blessing
But how come it always feel like the devil plottin'
And the devil watchin'?
He see me buyin' all these watches
Benjamin Franklin in my pockets
Ooh, been a year of the glitz and the glam
And the TV channels, brain's going scramble
Scrambling sometimes 'cause this shit is hard to handle
Demons in my heart (Yeah), they destroy me like a vandal (Ah)


[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up

[Chorus]
Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days

[Verse 2]
Karma ain't what you think it is
Super stressed, still handle all of my business
Do the best I can, yes, I can
Yes, I am, misfortune
I know in the dark, they be lurking (Why?)
Same way they lurk in your head when they get in your mind
You don't wanna know what they're tryin' to find
I'll protect your soul (Ah)


[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up

[Chorus]
Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days
Sebbene la massa del Sole incurvi lo spazio-tempo
E ogni religione punti sul concetto di eternità
Ci rivolgiamo alle agenzie di viaggi e seguitiamo ad aver paura
La stessa di quello scrittore americano del Novecento
Che gli costò perplessità nei confronti del progresso
Accuse di razzismo e letteratura da quattro soldi
Viviamo l'orizzonte degli eventi
Oltrepassarlo ci spaventa e ci esalta insieme
Al ventennale dell'esame di stato non sono andato
Ma continuo a immaginare ciò che mi riserverà il futuro
E quale inno mio figlio canterà
Bucare l'orizzonte degli eventi
Questo vogliamo tutti
Quando facciamo sport per rimanere giovani
Preghiamo la Madonna, o ci appoggiamo la

Il ragazzo, la famiglia, una gatta

Meglio la maleducazione che una

[Verse 1]
When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers, falling tender
Long before the days of no surrender
Years ago
And well you know?


[Pre-Chorus 1]
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
Cause I don't know how

[Chorus]
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you
Is that lost on you?


[Verse 2]
Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine

[Pre-Chorus]
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around

[Chorus]
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Lost on you
Lost on you

Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Is that lost on you?

[Verse 1]
Is this a dream again?
I can't see nobody else
Don't want to live again
Stay here forever
In this blue sunken dream
Black and white is turning green
I'd be forever young, and never die, just like the gods above

[Pre-Chous]
I'm seeing things I've never seen
Is this a dream or something real?

[Chorus]
Go go gorilla take me where you go oh
Go go gorilla take me where you go oh
Take me with you
Take me with you

[Verse 2]
Would you go back again?
Loving lovers in the night
Animals all in white
Laughing at life
I talked to the lighting man
Oh and he told me not to leave
'Cause like the gods above, always in love, I'd live forever


[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seeing things I've never seen
Is this a dream or something real?

Go go gorilla take me where you go oh

Hey pretty baby now, I'd like to bring 'em all out
I like to work them things, I like to shake them out
Hey pretty baby now, feel like it's comin' all out
Why don't you come with me, I'd like to shake you down
(Why don't you come with me, why don't you come with me)
(Why don't you come with me, why don't you come with me)
Why don't you come with me, I'd like to show you 'round

Is this a dream again?

[Chorus]
Go go gorilla take me where you go oh
Go go gorilla take me where you go oh
Take me with you
Take me with you
[Songtext zu „schon okay“]

[Intro]
Ah

[Strophe 1]
Nimm, nimm, nimm von mir alles, was du brauchst
Ich meine heute ist Black Friday, alles raus, alles für lau
Hab' jede meiner Schwächen tief in mei'm Schatten versteckt
Hab' mein'n Charakter und den Kaffee für uns beide aufgesetzt

[Refrain]
Ist schon okay (Hey)
Ich klaue Blum'n und schenk' sie dir (Hey, hey)
Und wenn du willst, dann geh mit mir (Hey, hey)
Oh, Baby, ich, ich still' bloß meine Gier mit dir (Ey, ey, wouh)

[Strophe 2]
Spiel, spiel, spiel mit mir, ich nehm' alles in Kauf
Ich bin süchtig nach dei'm Atem, deiner Stimme, deiner Haut, ja
Du pumpst jede Woche und mein Ego weiter auf
Ich werde stolz und betrunken laut, ja

[Refrain]
Ist schon okay (Hey, ist schon okay)
Ich klaue Blum'n und schenk' sie dir (Hey, hey, oh ja)
Und wenn du willst, dann geh mit mir (Hey, hey)
Oh, Baby, ich, ich still' bloß meine Gier mit dir (Wouh)


[Bridge]
Will all'n gefall'n und dir noch mehr
Nimm die Blum'n und gib sie bitte nie mehr wieder her
Bin Nächte lang wach, mir geht's gut, ja, ich lach'
Du guckst und ich tu so, als wenn das gar nix mit mir macht
So viele Möglichkeiten, die laut in meinem Kopf passier'n
Ich hab' kein'n Will'n, will nur küssen, will nie wieder was verlier'n

[Refrain]
Ist schon okay (Hey)
Ich klaue Blum'n und schenk' sie dir (Hey, hey)
Und wenn du willst, dann geh mit mir (Hey, hey)
Oh, Baby, ich, ich still' bloß meine Gier mit dir

[Outro]
Ich still' bloß meine Gier (Hey, oh-oh)
Ja, ich still' bloß meine Gier (Uh-uh, hey, wouh)
Was soll mir die Zeit jetzt weiterhelfen
Wenn es das ist, was ich gar nicht brauch'
Will der Grund sein für dein Strahlen der Augen
Für die Falten, wenn du lächelst auch
Ich schau’ mir Dokus an aus Langeweile
Hätte lieber dein Gesicht vor mir
Wie rauchen Zigaretten After Sex ?????
In meiner Dachgeschosswohnung Hausnummer 4

Und grüne Augen lügen nicht
Ich seh' dich grade, ich
Ich seh' dich grade nicht
Und grüne Augen lügen nicht

Angst vor Stagnation, hab Angst vor Stillstand
Angst vor zu viel Raum in meinem Kopf
Und geh’n wir letztes Jahr zur selben Uhrzeit
Gib' mir deine Lippen und dein Duft
Ich kann dich nicht vergessen
Wenn ich könnte würd' ich's lassen
Oh Baby, leg' dein Kopf in meinen Arm
Wieso hat jedes Kennzeichen dieser fucking Stadt
Die Anfangsbuchstaben
Unserer Namen, jaa

Und grüne Augen lügen nicht
Ich seh' dich grade, ich
Ich seh' dich grade nicht
Und grüne Augen lügen nicht


Und grüne Augen lügen nicht
Ich seh' dich grade, ich
Ich seh’ dich grade nicht
[Intro: Sita]
I don't care if you walk over me
Baby all over me
For a while
No I don't mind
No I don't care

[Chorus: Cards &amp; Sita]
I don't care if you walk over me
Baby all over me
For a while
I know why you've been dreaming of me
'Cause you walk over me
And I smile

[Verse 1: Cards]
You could say I learnt a lot living
Did a lot of both
Wanna make change
Think I'm going broke
And my soul
And my soul
No I don't mind
No I don't care

[Chorus: Cards &amp; Sita]
I don't care if you walk over me
Baby all over me
For a while
I know why you've been dreaming of me
'Cause you walk over me
And I smile


[Bridge: Cards &amp; Sita]
I don't mind if you
I don't mind if you
I don't care if you walk over me
Baby all over me
For a while
No I don't mind
No I don't care

[Chorus: Cards &amp; Sita]
I don't care if you walk over me
Baby all over me
For a while
I know why you've been dreaming of me
'Cause you walk over me
And I smile
I don't care if you walk over me
Baby all over me
For a while
I know why you've been dreaming of me
'Cause you walk over me
And I smile
[Chorus: CARDS]
In a minute i'll be stone
Gonna give it to you cold
I don't wanna hurt your feelings
But i think that you should know
Anybody ever thought that they could steal away the flow
Left me all the shine
Left me all the Glow-owowowowowowow

Should have never stooped that low
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold

[Chorus: CARDS]
In a minute i'll be stone
Gonna give it to you cold
I don't wanna hurt your feelings
But i think that you should know
Anybody ever thought they could steal away the flow
Left me all the shine
Left me all the Glow-owowowowowowow

Should have never stooped that low
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold


[Bridge: TxTHEWAY]
(2, 3)
Okay I'm shining shining shining
Like a diamond diamond diamond
They can't stop me stop me stop me
You know up in the bezel
It gets rocky rocky rocky it gets cold
Dripping from my arm, neck, wrist to my toes
You know

How it goes when the knife's in her right hand
She cuts and I bleed, an ocean (I bleed, I bleed)
You took my heart on the road
But you left me all the shine
Left me all the Glow-owowowowowowow

Should have never stooped that low
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold

[Outro: CARDS]
Left behind the Gold
Left behind the Gold
Left behind the Gold
Left behind the Gold
Left behind the Gold
[Verse 1]
I don't know
Where do I go from here?
I'm way down, down
I'd be lying if I said I had a plan
After everything that went wrong
I'm way down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can, and I can yeah
Go through the motions
Gonna take the flow over any emotion
I'm way down

[Chorus]
Still I swear, and I swear that
Oh, you've seen one too many movies
You know love ain't that confusing
Said one too many
And I swear, and I swear that
Oh, you're the only girl who knew me
And the only one who'd do me like that

[Verse 2]
Gotta take a night job
Gotta pay the lease
And, gotta take a bill just to get through the weekend
I'm way down, down, down


[Pre-Chorus]
And I can, and I can yeah
Go through the motions
Gonna take the flow over any emotion
I'm way down

[Chorus]
Still I swear, and I swear that
Oh, you've seen one too many movies
You know love ain't that confusing
Said one too many
And I swear, and I swear that
Oh, you're the only girl who knew me
And the only one who'd do me like that

[Bridge]
I don't know
Where do I go from here?
I'm way down

[Chorus x2]
Still I swear, and I swear that
Oh, you've seen one too many movies
You know love ain't that confusing
Said one too many
And I swear, and I swear that
Oh, you're the only girl who knew me
And the only one who'd do me like that

[Part 1: Bonez MC]
International mach' ich Beute mit der Gang
Und ist immer ganz normal, dass die Leute mich erkenn'n
Circa 26 Gra-ad auf dem Schulterbla-att
Auto ohne Dach wie der deutsche Präsident
Glaub mir, niemand kann mich stoppen, Scheiße, nein, es hört nicht auf
Frauen lieben meine Locken, bin auch meistens gut gelaunt
187 auf Klamotten und ich weiß, du weißt es auch
Bin sowas so wie ein Boss und aus den Boxen kommt:
„K-K-K-K-KitschKrieg, KitschKrieg“ (Haha)
Brauche kein Designershirt, nein
Brauch' nur meine Clarks, damit lauf' ich über Glas
Nagelneue Glock bestellt, pflanze weiter Ot im Zelt
Überall mein Fußabdruck, Freiheit für den Boss der Welt


[Hook: Bonez MC &amp; Vybz Kartel]
Oh mein Gott, wir fahr'n mit Kilos über Grenzen rüber (Grenzen rüber)

Zahl' das Kilogramm bar, pack' paar Mille aus
Nternational criminal, really loud
Ist der Ballermann scharf? Heh, find es raus
(Let me tell yuh wha gwaan in yah tonight, from yasso, tune!)

[Part 2: Vybz Kartel]
Germany, Germany, roll up a Benz, it's luxury eternally
Whole world heard a me, Worl' Boss, my name high like herbalist
Ghetto journalist, realest, mek di system waan murder me
But me full a strength, world government
Get the effigies, light it up and mek it burn
Send the message quick and them will learn, Pharaoh rising
Mi a dem poison, death is earned
Get his urn, I strike lightning, it hurt
The more them fight it, wizard
Mi drive them desert, insert chorus (Insert chorus)

[Part 1]
Ich muss aufhören, den Frauen immer übel zu nehmen (was?)
Auf was für Typen sie steh'n
Ich steh' doch auch selber nur auf die narzisstischen Mädels mit Drogen- und Psychoproblemen (Shit)
Hollywood, Hollywood (Shit)
Die Lüge des Lebens
Wenn sie nicht will, Junge, dann chill
Lern mal, dadrüber zu steh'n (chill)
Du bist verletzt und ein Frauenhasser
Dann nutzt du Rap, um es raus zu lassen
Aber ich glaub', wär' ich 'ne Frau
Hätt' ich 'nen Spast wie dich auch verlassen (zurecht)
Ich bin auch nicht besser, in jeder Beziehung letztendlich ein Arsch
Auch ich möchte mich mal verlieben (-lieben)
Also gib mir das MDMA

[Pre-Hook]
Ich bin so emotionslos, ich könnte heul'n
Ich bin so emotionslos, ich könnte heul'n
Ich bin so emotionslos, ich könnte heul'n
Ich bin so emotionslos, ich könnte heul'n

[Hook]
Denn ich kann eure Lovesongs nicht fühlen (nicht fühlen)
Egal wie weich sie Marktforscher spül'n (sie spülen)
Der Handel mit den Narcos erblüht
Egal in welchen Farben ihr den Pathos versprüht
Und ich kann eure Lovesongs nicht fühlen (nicht fühlen)
Egal wie weich sie Marktforscher spül'n (sie spülen)
Der Handel mit den Narcos erblüht
Egal in welchen Farben ihr den Pathos versprüht


[Part 2]
Ja, ich bin sehr dumm und umgebe mich dauernd
Mit unglaublich heißen, vergebenen Frauen
Die Männer sind nett, sympathisch und schlau
Da wird doch im Leben nix laufen (no)
Meine Homes hab'n 'nen Ring an ihr'm Finger
Parallel dazu bin ich bei Tinder (eh)
Parallel dazu haben sie Kinder (ja)
Parallel dazu bin ich be—
Ich will nur 'ne Frau, die mich schon morgens fickt wie die BVG
Wieso kommt'n jetzt die scheiß Ringbahn nicht?
Ne, ich hab' nicht geweint, meine Augen sind rot von THC
Jaja, ich weiß, ich kiff' gar nicht

[Pre-Hook]
Ich bin so emotionslos, ich könnte heul'n
Ich bin so emotionslos, ich könnte heul'n
Ich bin so emotionslos, ich könnte heul'n
Ich bin so emotionslos, ich könnte heul'n

Egal wie weich sie Marktforscher spül'n (sie spülen)
Der Handel mit den Narcos erblüht
Egal in welchen Farben ihr den Pathos versprüht


[Part 3]
Scheiße (Shit)
Wo sind meine Emotionen?
Sie fragt, „Liebst du mich?
Oder meinst du das ironisch?“ (was?)
Wo verdammt sind meine Emotionen?
Sie fragt, „Liebst du mich denn wirklich?
Oder meinst du das ironisch?“
Fuck, das ist 'ne Empfindung
Fuck, das ist wie 'ne Bindung
Ich bin nicht perfekt, sie ist nicht perfekt
Fuck, ich muss hier verschwinden
Denn ich kann eine magische Fähigkeit mein Eigen nenn'n
Ich kann auch da Probleme sehen, wo keine sind (keine)

[Bridge]
Ich hab' Angst vor jedem Dreck
Ich hab' Angst, dass ich dich verletz'
Ich hab' Angst, dass du mich verlässt
Nur keine Angst vorm Hier und Jetzt
Ich hab' Angst vor jedem Dreck
Ich hab' Angst, dass du mich verlässt
Ich hab' Angst, dass ich dich verletz'
Nur keine Angst vorm Hier und Jetzt

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour &amp; Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour &amp; Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells
[Verse 1]
With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', "Black Lives Matter"
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', "Nigga," this, and, "Nigga," that
Call everybody, "Nigga," and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, "Nigga," then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear


[Verse 2]
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, "All Lives Matter," is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, "Nigga," is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine


[Outro]
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not racist
[Intro]
Hangin' out where I don't belong is nothing new to me
I get tired and I get sick and then I lose the strength to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't handle change
I can't handle change

[Chorus]
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good

[Bridge]
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)

[Outro]
I can't help but repeat myself
"I know it's not your fault"
Still lately I begin to shake
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
[Skit 1]
"Do I know you?"
"Yes, you do"
"This seems so familiar"
"You're in a dream"
"Who are you?"
"I am your reflection, you've been asleep for a very long time"

[Verse 1]
I lay awake every night, looking back on my life
Will apologies to the people I love for the things I've done really make it right?
I guess it might, just then I realized
My past is the reason I'm here right now, as a matter of fact, I won't apologize
You bitches always pissed 'cause I am constantly changing
Think of how far that I've made it from my incarceration, it's amazing, ain't it?
But I'm in the zone, I'm a rolling stone, I'm coming home, but I'm not alone
Do I really gotta let another motherfucker know?

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't surrender, surrender
No, I won't let you bring me down

[Chorus]
So where the hell do I go from here?
Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Like everyone's out to get me
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes


[Skit 2]
"Uh, daddy?"
"Yes, honey?"
"Why did you go to jail?"
"Uh"

[Verse 2]
I'm a lot smarter than you think, everything I did was planned
To get you to listen, to get your attention, so you post your opinion, and it gets me bigger
Are you triggered? Haha, figures
Here's the kicker: with every trigger, I'm getting richer from offended bitter little
Twitter bitches all up in my mentions, looking for attention 'cause they're starved of it
You wanna call me king of the music scene? I got news for you, I'm the god of it
Like the second coming
I respawn like I have a reset button, hated more than Trump is
Ronnie Radke's back to rapping, acting ratchet, release the Kraken, delete your asses
I'm not the rapture, I'm the motherfucking morning after

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't surrender, surrender
No, I won't let you bring me down

[Chorus]
So where the hell do I go from here?
Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Like everyone's out to get me
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes


[Breakdown]
I need a miracle
I'm falling way too fast, I'm sinking in too deep
I need an angel now that's watching over me
If I could just wake up, if I could make you see
I'm all alone, all alone with your sickness in me

[Skit 3]
"Dad, Dad, Dad, wake up"
"Ah, fuck, what the..?"
"You were having a bad dream"
"Where am I? Turn the fucking music off, who the fuck are you?"
"I'm your daughter"
"Oh, no, no, you're too old to be my daughter, what year is it?"
"It's 2033, Dad"
"Oh, no, no, it's not, no, no, no, no"
"You've been asleep for a very long time"

[Chorus]
So where the fuck do I go from here?
Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Everyone's out to get me
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me 'cause I'm really trying
I just kill myself sometimes


[Post-Chorus]
I'm falling way too fast, I'm sinking in too deep
I need an angel now that's watching over me
If I could just wake up, if I could make you see
I'm all alone, all alone with your sickness in me

[Outro]
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes

People look at me, and they tell me

[Verse 1]
Your eyes, so crisp, so green
Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet
Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but I can't resist
And I said

[Chorus]
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh


[Verse 2]
I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we're dancin' in my living room, and up come my fists
And I say I'm only playing, but the truth is this
I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified, but the truth is this
I said

[Chorus]
Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
And I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
For me to fall

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally

[Verse 1: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the shadows where darkness crawls
And the spiderwebs between it all
We are the slither underneath your feet
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 2: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the pain of the rotten tooth
Of every child with hallow loot
We are the snake in your kitten's tree
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 3: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
Some with horns and some with fangs
A hundred eyes and giant brains
From the depths of the cosmic sea
All my friends are creeps
(All my friends are creeps)
(All my friends are creeps)

[Verse 4: Matt Montgomery and (Ash Costello)]
We are the fly in your baby food
Monsters of the foulest mood
We haunt every house and dream
All my friends are creeps

Annabelle
We're both going to hell
You're gonna love the clientele
Cheap rent and the climate's swell
Annabelle
I've been drunk since half past twelve
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down

[Pre-Chorus]
The world, it seems
To be ending constantly
Between the smoke and drink and getting high
I'd shed a tear if I could find the time, oh

[Chorus]
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) God can't save us
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) So let's live like sinners
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
My reassurances; it's not that bad
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) You gotta live a little when the world just wants you sad

[Verse 2]
Annabelle
Where the forbidden dwell
Come lay me down
Come lay me down

The world, it seems
To be ending constantly
Between the smoke and drink and getting high
I'd shed a tear if I could find the time, oh

(Ahh-ahh-ahh) God can't save us

Commiserations to your mum and your dad

The heavens are open
The angels descending
God bless you, undress you
And this unhappy ending
The underworld kids
Of the choir will sing
Hallelujah!
"God has left the building"

Commiserations to your mum and your dad
My reassurances; it's not that bad
(Ahh-ahh-ahh) You gotta live a little when the world just wants you sad
The backbone of this country is the independent truck
The power of the trucker comes from his truck
The best thing about trucks is the cab overhead
That's where those truckers generate their

Backbone!
Backbone!
Backbone!
Backbone!

Holding my hand while I piss in her face
She’ll do it with love, sitting in a cage
She loves it more if you treat like a race
I keep yelling, while smoking my [?] pulling tighter on
I keep fucking up, so it's you I disgrace

Backbone!
Backbone!
Backbone!

Move you move like an animal
Making a noise like an animal
Fornicate and fornicate
Sing a song about fucking


Make you move like an animal
Making a noise like an animal
Bake a chicken and pluck an eye

Sing a song about fornicate
Sing a song about fornicate
Fornicate and fornicate

[Verse 1]
They tore a hole right through my soul
I could have hid it years ago
Always assumed that it'd be a phase
I should have this all worked out at my age

[Pre-Chorus]
Some days I feel like crying, and I know you feel that too
But life don't seem as dark when I sing with you, with you

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, I choose to live
Oh, oh, oh, I choose to live

[Verse 2]
Young enough to still have a heart
Old enough to fall apart
And now we're drinking in the park
In our twenties, in our aging skin at dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Some days I feel like crying, and I know you feel it too
But life don't seem as dark when I sing with you, with you

[ Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, I choose to live
Oh, oh, oh, I choose to live


[Pre-Chorus]
Some days I feel like crying, and I know you feel that too
But life don't seem as dark when I sing with you, with you

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, I choose to live
Oh, oh, oh, I choose to live
[Verse 1]
I was born cold, so much colder than you
A transparent brute
A black heart you see right through
You’re all spirit, all auburn and morning
I’m the smoker’s health
The hangman hangs himself

[Chorus]
Do I look so good that you wanna treat me bad?
We sleep together me and you because we’ve nothing else to do

[Verse 2]
Midnight and back in luck on the hood of your father’s truck
Fall fast and feel the devil at the wheel

[Chorus]
Do I look so good that you wanna treat me bad?
We sleep together me and you because we’ve nothing else to do. [2X]

[Bridge]
Try to feel, try to feel anything
Pretty boys, pretty girls, petty promise rings
Let’s die young and swoon
Let’s both be doomed together. [3X]


[Chorus]
Do I look so good that you wanna treat me bad?
We sleep together me and you because we’ve nothing else to do
Do I look so good that you wanna treat me bad?
We sleep together me and you because we’ve nothing else...
[Hook]
Lately I haven’t felt like myself
I take my pills never mind my health
The doc said they’d work saying that they’d help
But I still feel worse yeah I feel like hell
Lately I haven’t felt like myself
I take my pills never mind my health
The doc said they’d work saying that they’d help
But I still feel worse yeah I feel like hell

[Verse]
Most of the time I wonder if I’ll make it
The problems that I have always leave me anxious
I don’t wanna die but my life won’t face it
Stuck inside my mind and my body can’t take it
The doctor gave me pills for the pain in my body
I throw up every night and every day like it’s my hobby
Forgotten and alone like my life is just a copy
Remember nights I cried when the mirror didn’t want me
Tell me do you really know how I feel?
I don’t know the difference for what’s right and what’s real
I don’t know the cure to this nausea that I feel
It’s been 3 whole days since I had my last meal
Anxiety makes me feel so worthless
I just stay in bed cause I’m always hurting
“You’ll be okay” yeah I’ve already heard it
What did I even do to make me deserve this?


[Hook]
Lately I haven’t felt like myself
I take my pills never mind my health
The doc said they’d work saying that they’d help
But I still feel worse yeah I feel like hell
Lately I haven’t felt like myself
I take my pills never mind my health
The doc said they’d work saying that they’d help
But I still feel worse yeah I feel like hell

[Outro]
You could stay here forever, if you want to
Really?
Sure! We’ll sing, and play games, and mother will cook your favorite meals
There’s one “tiny” little thing we need to do
What’s that?
Well, it’s a surprise

Won’t do for you, I do for you
When I hit you at your condo real late
Check the scene and see if you straight
Then cut like kids cake
I got that feelin' for you, that feelin' that you crave
Each time I do it for you, I make that bad pussy behave
Now pop it, bottles, the top is so open
The budget, I'm Party so fuck it

Let my money get older and older
And older and older like Regis
And she will not fuck with no broke niggas
No, nigga, only the richest

You a freak and your cover's blown
How you talked me into sendin' that to you, I'll never know
Fuck it, girl; I'm 'bout whatever though

I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

[Verse 1]
Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished


[Pre-Chorus]
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me


[Pre-Chorus]
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well

Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine
We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine


[Verse 2: Drake]
Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, "You was this and you had this"
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, "you're such a dog", I said, "you're such a bone."
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine


[Outro: Birdman]
Yeah! Drizzy, yo' turn, nigga!
Take Care of the business, nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business, nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck 'em, we don't love 'em!
Yeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest niggas
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit, fellas
OVO YMCMB (believe that!)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing
Throwin' hundreds, rubber band stacks
That YMCMB shit, nigga; flashy lifestyle
One hundred
Hangul

I don't try to be mean on purpose, I promise
My mama taught me better than that, I'll be honest
I blame it on the drugs and this life I'm involved in

[Verse 1]
It was the year
I didn’t check the terms and conditions of your heart, dear
You wrote out your song
That swept into the summer of it all, it all

[Chorus]
It was the time
Your mama warned us all that you were gone
She told me love had ﬁxed you, turned you wrong
That winter, you were calling out your song, song, oh

[Drop]

Ooh, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)

Hey boy, give me back your love
Won’t you hinder to my heart and we sit among the stars?
The stars, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, stars


[Chorus]
It was the time
Your mama warned us all that you were gone
She told me love had ﬁxed you, turned you wrong
That winter, you were calling out your song (Let's go)

[Verse 1: Lily James]
I’ve never felt this strong
I’m invincible, how could this go wrong?
No, here, here’s where we belong
I see a road ahead
I never thought I would dare to tread

[Chorus: Meryl Streep]
Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
All I love so dearly
Images passing by
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words I try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don’t possess you
With all my heart, God bless you
You will be my love and my life
You’re my one and only

[Verse 2: Meryl Streep]
I held you close to me
Felt your heart beat
And I thought: I am free
Oh yes, and as one are we
In the now and beyond
Nothing and no one can break this bond


[Chorus: Meryl Streep &amp; Amanda Seyfried]
Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
All I love so dearly
Images passing by
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words I try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don’t possess you
With all my heart, God bless you
You are still my love and my life

[Outro: Meryl Streep &amp; Amanda Seyfried]
Yes, I know I don’t possess you
With all my heart, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
You’re my one and only
[Verse 1]
I'll
Never let you go
Now we flow in a way
That I'd say is just terrible
I
Won't lift my head today
What a time to be fine
And to try to feel miserable

[Pre-Chorus]
Misinterpretations
In every breath I take
Another day on earth to try
To make a sense of other lives
Don't know why we're heading west
I'm gonna fall and I'll shake it loose
In the end when I
Look back I think I'll say
It was worth a try

[Chorus]
How long
How long
Can I fake it?
How long
How long
Until they hate me?
More of what I can not grasp
More of what I can not grasp


[Verse 2]
I'll
Never let it show
Where we go? I don't know
But I think we've been here before
I
Won't lift my head today
What a time to be fine
And to try to feel miserable

[Pre-Chorus]
Misinterpretations
In every breath I take-

[Chorus]
How long
How long
Can I fake it?
How long
How long
Until they hate me?
More of what I can not grasp

[Bridge]
Tell why should I believe
In what my eyes can't see
No one's handed me the key
Yet I'm breakin' free
Takin' a step back in time
Throwin' up thoughts I thought were mine
Again I'm above water
But I can not breath
Let the ritual begin
'cause it's time to bleed
Takin' a step back in time
Throwin' up thoughts I thought were mine


[Chorus]
How long
How long
Can I fake it?
How long
How long
Until they hate me?
More of what I can not grasp

[Outro]
How long
How long
Can I fake it?
More of what I can not grasp
More of what I can not grasp
How long
Can I fake it?
How long
Until they hate me?
More of what I can not grasp
[Verse 1]
Would you be-be-be my armageddon
As we fall-fall-fall out of heaven
Unkept, unswept, and unforgiven
I'll be choking and drinking and dying
And dreaming of you

[Pre-Chorus]
When the sun comes we vanish like vampires
We're gonna die in the summer

[Chorus]
Baby, you could be my end
So kiss me in the dying light
Our last night on earth could be so cute
You could be my end
But I don't wanna die tonight
At the hand of anybody else but you

[Verse 2]
And the cops came down in anticipation
Of a sky on fire like Revelation
Can we burn and burn into temptation?
Scorch my song, let my bones, my body decay

[Pre-Chorus]
When the sun comes we vanish like vampires
We're gonna die in the summer


[Chorus]
Baby, you could be my end
So kiss me in the dying light
Our last night on earth could be so cute
Yeah You could be my end
But I don't wanna die tonight
At the hand of anybody else but you

[Bridge]
Descend on me like an angel
Descend on me like the devil you are

[Chorus]
Baby, you could be my end
So kiss me in the dying light
Our last night on earth could be so cute
Yeah this could be the end
But I don't wanna die tonight
At the hand of anybody else but you
[Intro]
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

[Verse 1]
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
This that throw up in your Birkin bag
Hook up with someone random
This that social awkward suicide
That buy your lips and buy your likes
I swear she had a man
But shit hit different when it's Thursday night

[Pre-Chorus]
That college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table
Just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman


[Chorus]
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you, and you, and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

[Verse 2]
This that hot girl bummer two-step
They can't box me in, I'm too left
This that drip, it's more like oceans
They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag
Yeah, that's the slogan
This that, "Who's all there?"
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken

[Pre-Chorus]
This that college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table
Just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman


[Chorus]
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you, and you, and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

[Bridge]
This that college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
We go stupid, we go stupid, we go—
And you want me to change? Fuck you!

[Chorus]
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you, and you, and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
[Chorus 1: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna wake up
I want you spread out on the sheets
Said pussy so good
And pussy so sweet, oh
I don't wanna wake up
I want it flowin' through my streams
Gettin' me hot
Under my feet
I don't wanna wake up

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Please don't wake me up, I feel it creepin' (Yeah)
Controllin' how you moving, lucid dreamin' (Dreams)
Always on the side of different seasons, yeah, yeah
Took the beltway down to your hood (It's lit!)
Say you was in the crowd, I never looked
Lookin' back how things came back around, guess I was hooked
Burn the bread and then we burn the town, we both was cooked, yeah
Nah, nah, please don't wake me up, feel like I'm dreamin'
Any given Sunday, you can get it, Willie Beamen
I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend (Yeah)
That's my Coco, I'm her Ice-T (Coco, yeah, yeah!)
Bend her over for some piping (It's lit!)
Bust a cloud, shoot the lightning (Pop it)
Pop it now, no, we can't sleep (Sleep)


[Chorus 2: Travis Scott]
I don't wanna wake up (Yeah)
Want you spread out on the sheets (It's lit!)
Say, pussy so good (Pop it)
Oh, pussy so sweet (Yeah)
When I wake up (Yeah, yeah)
Want a drop top on the beach (Straight up!)
Getting me hot, yeah (Yeah)
Under my feet
When I wake up

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
You decide if I live or die
When you're close, I'm alive, I can feel the sky
I just want your body close to me, oh!
And if I OD, I'll be alone with no heartbeat
I hope they kill us with a ghost in the Lambo
And the doors goin' up, suicide

[Chorus 1: The Weeknd]
I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want you spread out on the sheets
(Want you spread out on the sheets)
'Cause that pussy so good (Pussy so good), yeah
Girl, that pussy so sweet (So sweet)
I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want it flowing through my streams
(Want it flowing through my streams)
Ha, getting me hot (Getting me hot)
Oh, under my feet (My feet)
I don't wanna wake up (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you li' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, "I don't fuck with you."
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…


[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…


[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…


[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)
[Verse 1]
I'm an exception
It's hard to accept
Because I try to be happy
But then I forget
They tell me I need to chill, man
It's all in your head
Maybe I'm paranoid

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I once had a thought
But don't know where it went
'Cause I've been living off soda
And cheap cigarettes
Maybe when I was a kid
I was dropped on my head
Yeah, that would make some sense


[Chorus]
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Well, you would look a little better, don't you know
If you just wore less make-up
But it's hard to realise when you're sky high
Fighting off the spaceships

[Pre-Chorus]
And so you're drinking in your room to make it all go
It didn't end too soon, you've got the next one
You're holding on too long, you've gotta let go
Your other love is gone and you know

[Chorus]
It's too late, it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late, it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same

[Verse 2]
I tried to find a quiet place that we could go
To help you make decisions
But I didn't find it easy to tell them apart
With double vision

[Pre-Chorus]
And so you're drinking in your room to make it all go
It didn't end too soon, you've got the next one
You're holding on too long, you've gotta let go
Your other love is gone and you know


[Chorus]
It's too late, it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late, it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late, it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late, it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the...

[Outro]
It's not the same, it's not the same, it's not the same
You're gonna tell me that I'm right
You know you're gonna come back down
Find yourself where you are again
You didn't know, you didn't know, you didn't know
So don't pretend you saw it now
It's not something you'd want to happen
Now you know who you are again
It's not the same, it's not the same, it's not the same
You're gonna tell me that I'm right
You know you're gonna come back down
Find yourself where you are again
[Verse 1]
Ocean blue
What have I done to you?
Cut so deep
Yet growing through and through

[Verse 2]
Drawn apart, New York and London
All I see now are distant drumlins
The roads I knew became a city
And I wonder, will you wait for me?

[Chorus]
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay, I know I'll stay right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say? What would you say? What would you do?

[Verse 3]
I built a hive, became one with the bees
But we fell like rain, got lost into the sea
If I don't know, the wind will carry me
So just hold tight

[Chorus]
Though I'm far away
I know I'll stay, I know I'll stay right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say? What would you say? What would you do?


[Bridge]
Over and over many setting suns
I have run, I have waited for the rain to come
When through that mist I see the shape of you
And I know, and I know that I'm in love with you

[Hook]
Though I'm far away
I know I'll stay, I know I'll stay right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say? What would you say? What would you do?
[Verse 1]
I don't know where I am going to rest my head tonight
So I won't promise that I'll speak to you today
But if I ever find another place, a better time
For that moment, I was never what I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Take to me to where you are, what you've become
And what you will do when I am gone
I won't forget, I won't forget

[Chorus 1]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year

[Verse 2]
In between the lines is the only place you'll find
What you're missing but you didn't know was there
So when I say goodbye, you must do your best to try
And forgive me this weakness, this weakness

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know what to say, another day
Another excuse to be sent your way
Another day, another year


[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year

[Post-Chorus]
And maybe sometime, in a long time
You'll remember what I had said there, I said
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year

[Bridge]
If you think of me
I will think of you

[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe sometime, in a long time
You'll remember what I had said there, I said
I'll be home for next year


[Chorus]
Maybe someday, you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me, saying
I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year
[Verse 1]
Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

[Verse 2]
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

[Refrain]
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

[Verse 3]
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give


[Refrain]
Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river

[Bridge]
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river
[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll, I'll)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes


[Chorus: Rihanna &amp; Drake]
'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll, I'll)
I've loved and I've lost
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true


[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll, I'll)
I've loved and I've lost
[Intro: Damian Lemar Hudson]
Okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, ladies and gentlemen, settle down
Okay, so, this next brother we're gonna bring up to the stage usually does not come in on Monday nights
You're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen
Give it to Mr. Hall

[Verse 1]
Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh
Flesh from my blood I caress
Right on the page so it's fresh
I take my time, but express
Lot on my mind, but I guess
It's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene
Kick in the door, we blow it off the hinge
Music my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe
It's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend
Therapist tell me I don't need to defend
Therapy tell me I don't need to explain
Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain
Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign
My queen's by my side like Manhattan
Fuck rapping, this is poetic conviction
My rendition is not meant for your diction
Battled addiction in the womb
A crack baby by definition
Keys to ignition with no permission
That mean that I'm driven
Alive 'cause I'm living
Fuck workin' with what you've been given
I knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five
And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did
'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did
Didn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid
All I knew was alcoholism and prison
Only saw domestic violence and racial division
Social worker trying to take me away
But I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way
At least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay
Adapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay


[Interlude]
Keep that one just in case, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm just an entity
My DNA, not my identity
Finding serenity
Become a better man, I better be
For the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy
We get big bread
Tryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead
I'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead
I'm trying to get ahead like a fetus
Money don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression
Being rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson
What's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing

[Verse 3]
Live it, live it
Living life like this is so crazy
Hip-hop is amazing
One day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em
Goddamn, what I'm facing
Every day a new frustration
People thinking I'm complacent
People thinking that I changed like a cashier
But I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere
I can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme
Give it up, you're out of time
Never even had a prime
Like the Preemo never linked up with 5'9"
Bitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae
Okay, fuck what you gotta say
I keep it going, already know when I'm flowing
For the listener, you're kind of like a therapist
Or rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus
That throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit
Fuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit
'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him
'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose
Wrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues
Word to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy
Life can hit you harder than Drago
But if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me
Never top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky
Okay, well, maybe sometimes
Occasionally in some rhymes
But it's fine, in due time
I'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it
An indigenous era of the indigenous emcee
Riding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E
What's up?


[Interlude]
(You-you-you-you-you)
(You-you), yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah (Yeah)
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah
(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)

[Verse 4]
Fuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness, than I could give a fuck less
I remember window shopping
Now I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room
Bobby coming soon
And that's the type of line I would've second-guessed
Putting on my shit before
Out of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate
'Cause it wasn't relevant
Give a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence
I'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me
You could tear me apart
But that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart
Where it's built from the start
Where it's finna stay
I've learned every day's a good day
Surrounded by people that love me
Don't want nothing from me but my happiness
Off the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest
Scrolling so much, my thumb fucked up
We call that carpal tunnel vision
Follow me like religion on this course of collision
Feeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics
As I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis
All this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus
I think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas
[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Four, four, four, four)
(Four, skate, four, skate, four, skate, four, skate)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I don't know where I’m going (Skate)

This is not apology (Skate)
You are such a distraction (Four)
That's what T on, aw (Skate)
Fuckin' up my ambiance, pause (Four)
You drive me cuckoo and not car (Skate)
'Cause I want you like Leon Ware (Fuck that)
Okay, say again it (Fuck that)
Okay, wait a minute (Woah)
I dread that shit, I am Anwar (Skate)
Curiosity killed the feline, gone (Four, skate)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator &amp; Solange]

[Post-Chorus: Solange &amp; Tyler, The Creator]
I notice that you're there, but I’m always in your hair
And you're always under my microscope (Four)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Waste of bread, I need your attention (Skate)
I'm off balance, I need some fixin' (Four)
I’m your puppet, you are Jim Henson (Skate, four)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator &amp; Solange]
Fallen in love now (Skate)

Take 'em to the bridge


[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
(Four, four, four)
Four, four, four, four (Four, skate)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator &amp; Solange]
I think I've fallen in love (Four)
Fell in love now (Skate)
This time I think it's for real (Four)
I think I'm in love now (Skate)
I think I've fallen in love (Four, skate)
This time I think it's for real (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Four, skate, four, skate)
[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms


[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah


[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)
RADWIMPSの「スパークル」歌詞

まだこの世界は　僕を飼いならしてたいみたいだ
望み通りいいだろう　美しくもがくよ

互いの砂時計　眺めながらキスをしようよ
「さよなら」から一番　遠い　場所で待ち合わせよう

ついに時はきた　昨日までは序章の序章で
飛ばし読みでいいから　ここからが僕だよ
経験と知識と　カビの生えかかった勇気を持って
いまだかつてないスピードで　君のもとへダイブを

まどろみの中で　生温いコーラに
ここでないどこかを　夢見たよ
教室の窓の外に
電車に揺られ　運ばれる朝に

運命だとか未来とかって　言葉がどれだけ手を
伸ばそうと届かない　場所で僕ら恋をする
時計の針も二人を　横目に見ながら進む
そんな世界を二人で　一生　いや、何章でも

生き抜いていこう

「はじめまして」なんてさ　遥か彼方へと追いやって
1000年周期を　一日で息しよう


辞書にある言葉で　出来上がった世界を憎んだ
万華鏡の中で　八月のある朝

君は僕の前で　ハニかんでは澄ましてみせた
この世界の教科書のような笑顔で

嘘みたいな日々を　規格外の意味を
悲劇だっていいから望んだよ
そしたらドアの外に
君が全部抱えて立っていたよ

運命だとか未来とかって　言葉がどれだけ手を
伸ばそうと届かない　場所で　僕ら遊ぼうか

愛し方さえも　君の匂いがした
歩き方さえも　その笑い声がした

いつか消えてなくなる　君のすべてを
この眼に焼き付けておくことは
もう権利なんかじゃない　義務だと思うんだ

運命だとか未来とかって　言葉がどれだけ手を
伸ばそうと届かない　場所で僕ら恋をする
時計の針も二人を　横目に見ながら進む
そんな世界を二人で　一生　いや、何章でも


生き抜いていこう

[Verse 1]
In the morning when I wake
And the sun is coming through
Oh, you fill my lungs with sweetness
And you fill my head with you
Shall I write it in a letter?
Shall I try to get it down?
Oh, you fill my head with pieces
Of a song I can't get out

[Chorus]
Can I be close to you?
Ooh-oo-oo-ooh, ooh-oo-oo-ooh
Can I be close to you?
Ooh-oo-oo-ooh, ooh-oo-oo-ooh

[Verse 2]
Can I take you to a moment
Where the fields are painted gold?
And the trees are filled with memories
Of the feelings never told?
When the evening pulls the sun down
And the day is almost through
Oh, the whole world, it is sleeping
But my world is you


[Chorus]
Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (aah), ooh (aah)
Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (aah), ooh (aah)
Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (aah), ooh (aah)
Can I be close to you?
(Ah) ooh (aah), ooh (aah)
Can I be close to you?
Ooh, ooh
[Produced by Boi-1da and Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know


[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake", girl don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know


[Outro]
I be yelling out "Money over everything!"
"Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…

[Outro Poem]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better
[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up


[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up


[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up

[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Post-Chorus]
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up

[Intro]
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo

[Verse 1]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

[Interlude]
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo

[Verse 2]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly


[Chorus 1]
And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
La-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I know the sun must set to rise"

[Chorus 2]
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

[Intro]
Okey, manos en el aire todo el mundo
Esto es: "Creeper vs Zombie"

[Creeper / Zarcort]
Tú no lo sabes, te estoy vigilando
Desde la distancia me estoy acercando
Soy una sombra y tú no te das cuenta
Hola, ¿qué tal? ¡Date la vuelta!

¡Boom!

Llegó la hora de volar
Acércate a mí porque vas a explotar
¿Qué me vas a hacer? ¿Qué me vas a morder?
Todo el mundo que me ve solo sabe correr

Vacas, caballos, pollos y ovejas
Quiero cenar tu cabeza en bandeja
Mira como tu cuerpo se aleja
Se han acabado las quejas

[Coro / Piter-G]
La batalla ya ha empezado
En un mundo muy cuadrado
Creeper y Zombie a línea de fuego donde sangre derramo


Eh, eh, mírame de frente
No me escondo, te deparará la muerte
We, eh, dentro del mundo de Minecraft sí que puedo valerme

La batalla ya ha empezado
En un mundo muy cuadrado
Creeper y Zombie a línea de fuego donde sangre derramo

Eh, eh, mírame de frente
No me escondo, te deparará la muerte
We, eh, dentro del mundo de Minecraft sí que puedo valerme

[Zombie / Cyclo]
Si te enfrentas al zombi, es que estás loco
Quieres matarme, golpéame en el coco
Nunca voy solo, siempre a compañado
Los rayos del sol, nunca me han gustado

Sera mejor Creeper que te quites, del camino
O te como el intestino
Tu cara es de chiste, no repliques, he vencido
A la mierda el explosivo

Me ven aparecer y del camino se quitan
Gritan cuando explotan como palomitas
Excítate, ven que coma tus tripas
Chica vente, serás mi comida


No te muevas si estás en la cueva, no queda salida
Estoy en cada esquina si la noche avecina
No necesito cocina pa' cocinar tu carne viva

[Coro / Piter-G]
La batalla ya ha empezado

Eh, eh, mírame de frente

We, eh, dentro del mundo de Minecraft sí que puedo valerme

[Creeper / Zarcort]
Yo no tengo brazos pero no me hacen falta
Solo un cabezazo y con eso me basta
Llámame piró-mano, el que todo lo devasta
No sería tu amigo ni aunque me pagaran pasta


No hay nada que pare esta tromba
Te van a caer meteoritos como bombas
Eso que vuela no se llama avión
¡Eso que vuela es un Zombie Volador!

[Zombie / Cyclo]
Bienvenidos al ritmo del Zombie
Chica ven aquí y mueve el pompis
También le meto autotune como Stephen Hawking
Te desmonto como un playmobil

Acércate, explótame
Brum, Brum, Brum
Vas a perder delante de to' Youtube
Acércate, explótame
Brum, Brum, Brum
Vas a perder delante de to' Youtube

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach


[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?

No church in the wild

[Intro]
If this is my last sh- my last shit
Uh, it definitely be mad important
And it would have to sound like a Prince song

[Chorus]
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfucking, motha, shut your mouth
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth

[Verse 1]
Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit, rappin', trappin', trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died, yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain't tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last Chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint


[Chorus]
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth

[Bridge]
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit (Igh)

[Verse 2]
Why toss my filter when she saving my life?
The same shit that kills us, always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dealer, God know who he be
Truth be told, he juiced me, introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh-oh-oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire, flyer on the wall, I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night, in the sky I get higher, higher

[Chorus]
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfucker, motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth


[Bridge]
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit (Igh)

[Chorus]
I'm still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth
Igh!
[Letra de "Lean" ft. Sammy &amp; Falsetto, Beltito &amp; Osquel]

[Intro]
¡Wuh!
Hola, mi girl (Falsetto babeh)
Superiority (Beltito)
Sammy
Towy

[Pre-Coro: Beltito]
A las tres se va pa'l beauty
A las cuatro va pa’l mall
Pa' eso de las cinco está a vapor
Se hizo las boobies y el booty
Viste de Christian Dior
Activa a to'a sus amigas con un call

[Coro: Towy, Falsetto]
La bebecita bebe lean y bebe whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
Es media salvaje, ella es adicta a mi dicky
Le mete al lean, le mete al whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
En la cama una salvaje y la castigo con mi dicky


[Verso 1: Towy]
Baby toma dos Jolly en un vaso de lean
Dando más vueltas que un patín
En la cama ya tiene en swing
Con el pelo saiyajin
En el Lexus dando vueltas con mi queen
No la mires, evítate el motín
Whisky toma, toma, pa' quedar en coma
Ojos chiquititos, falta que hable en otro idioma
Con sus posiciones parece de goma
A mí me encanta cuando llama pa' que llegue y me la coma

[Coro: Towy, Falsetto]
Le mete al lean, le mete al whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
En la cama una salvaje y la castigo con mi dicky
La bebecita bebe lean y bebe whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
Es media salvaje, ella es adicta a mi dicky

[Verso 2: Osquel]
Ella es una bellaca
Chingamos en la sala y en la hamaca
Recostao's de la butaca encima de toa's las pacas
Cinco-doce pa'l sistema y media flaca
Y te meto to'a la noche, ponte en cuatro, mami, pero en tacas
De Giuseppe, yo soy el que le reparte a to's el peti
Me roncan de mujeres y andan con Betty spaghetti
Me recuerdo aquel día en que yo te metí
Apúntamo' el blanco y en tu culo te puse una x


[Coro: Towy]
La bebecita bebe lean y bebe whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
Es media salvaje, ella es adicta a mi dicky
Le mete al lean, le mete al whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
En la cama una salvaje y la castigo con mi dicky

[Verso 3: Beltito]
Yo no me meto pali por qué siempre borro cinta
Me ves en la disco tú te pegas y te afincas, te trincas y brincas
Brincoteando tú te desenvuelves
Si te envuelves rápido que la redonda se disuelve en tu sistema
El opio baja por lo digestivo, pa'l hígado el castigo
El efecto secundario es efectivo masivo
Yo nunca me fatigo, cabeza grande pa' tu toto es algo destructivo

[Coro: Towy, Falsetto]
La bebecita bebe lean y bebe whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
Es media salvaje, ella es adicta a mi dicky
Le mete al lean, le mete al whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
En la cama una salvaje y la castigo con mi dicky


[Verso 4: Sammy]
Conmigo estás segura y no con los bobos aquellos
Recuerda que son dieciocho mil euros encima de mi cuello
Yo no camello, yo soy un lindo sin tener un sello
A tu gata la atropelló y te la estrello
A ella le gusta, a ella le encanta, se atraganta, hasta las canta
Ella siempre lo escupe por qué no cabe completo
Y mala mía es que mi bicho es inquieto

[Coro: Towy, Falsetto]
La bebecita bebe lean y bebe whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
Es media salvaje, ella es adicta a mi dicky
Le mete al lean, le mete al whisky
Fuma marihuana y también se mete picky
Senda bellacona, frikitona, friki, friki
En la cama una salvaje y la castigo con mi dicky

La nueva generación
Dicho y hecho
Wrapped in black cloth
I found by the bed
You're turning the lights off
And I am covering my face
You should do what you want

I can't stop you now and I won't try

Breathing slower now
We turn the TV back on
You should do what you want with him
But I don't want to see you with him

I can't stop you now and I won't try

I've been searching for a way to stay in dreams
But I'm waking up and feeling sick and feeling dizzy
It’s always ending, always ending, always ending
It's always ending, always ending, always ending
Can we see
The beautiful
Pictures
Of your life
Projected on the side of a house
When fall comes
They'll find me
Covering
My eyes
In a pose reminiscent of a child
Scared of
The dark
But it's not the dark
That scares me
And when I go, I
Hope you'll
Give me
Back to
The sky
And keep me out of your dreams, I have no place there
Spill the blood of the innocent (Reversed Intro)

I have dreamt about what it's like to die
And I saw myself becoming shadows again
Just like I did when I was a kid
I saw my bones crack open and all the things I've been hiding from you spill out
All the secrets that i never thought I'd tell anyone about
I am warm and I am bored and I am drifting through this place
It's no better or worse than anything else that's ever happened to me
But I wish that I'd never met a lot of the people that I've met
Not because I don't like them but because I only let them down
And when you disappoint everyone all the time it's hard not to want to die
Constantly I feel this weird and shameful feeling
Like I'm being watched by a thousand glowing, vengeful eyes
Behind one way mirrors in public bathrooms and in metro cars
And everywhere I go I know I'm not welcome
[Video Prelude]

[Intro]
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

[Verse 1]
I'm your national anthem, God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?", he said, "Yes, yes, yes…"

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me so wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Refrain 1]
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss


[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
("Yes, of course I will, my darling")

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me so wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Bridge]
It's a love story for the new age, for the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel


[Refrain 2]
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up, give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

[Chorus]
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me so wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

[Outro]
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
[Chorus]
I got room in my fumes (Yeah)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It’s lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (Ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I’m doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)
Hope we make it outta here (Ah)
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Case it’s fumes (Smoke)
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I’m the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let’s go, yeah)


[Verse 2]
We ain't stressin' 'bout the loot (Yeah)
My block made of quesería
This not the molly, this the boot
Ain’t no comin' back from here
Live the life of La Familia
It's so much gang that I can't see ya (Yeah)
Turn it up 'til they can't hear (We can't)
Runnin', runnin' 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dawg, dawg, 'round my real (Gang)
Raw, raw, I been pourin' to the real (Drank)
Nah, nah, nah, they not back of the VIP (In the VIP)
Gorgeous, baby, keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life, I did not choose
Uh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, I fill my mind up with ideas

[Chorus]
Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I'm the highest in the room (I'm the highest, it's lit)
Hope I make it outta here

[Outro]
[Verse 1]
We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us

[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

[Verse 2]
And poison me, daddy
I got the Jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone
A beach of drowning three-year olds
Rest in peace Lil Peep
The poetry is in the streets
Jesus save us
Modernity has failed us


[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
I'd love it if we made it

Tell me something I didn't know

[Bridge]
Consultation
Degradation
Fossil fueling
Masturbation
Immigration
Liberal kitsch
Kneeling on a pitch

[Verse 3]
"I moved on her like a bitch!"
Excited to be indicted
Unrequited house with seven pools
"Thank you Kanye, very cool!"
The war has been incited
And guess what, you're all invited
And you're famous
Modernity has failed us


[Outro]
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
[Verse 1]
Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part
For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart

[Verse 2]
I'll quote "on the road" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
You smashed a glass into pieces
And that's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette
You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet


[Bridge 1]
And she said, "I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that"

[Verse 4]
You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart
I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Bridge 2]
Then she said, "I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit, but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'"
Oh, I just had a change of heart
​
[Outro]
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
Oh, I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
[Verse 1]
And she lays down on her bedroom floor
The chemicals that make her love
Don't seem to be working anymore
She tries her best, but it hurts her chest
And even though her sun is gone
She'd like to love her child nevertheless

[Verse 2]
My hair is brown, she's scared to touch
And she just wants to feel something
And I don't think that's asking for too much
And when I go to sleep it's when she begins to weep

[Chorus]
She's appalled by not loving me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

[Verse 3]
We got a plane, oh to see my dad again
She prayed that we'd fall from the sky
Simply to alleviate the pain
Over water, hmm
Over terrain
The engines all go bust, we turned to dust
And I've no reason to complain, yeah
And in the end, she chose cocaine
But it couldn't fix her brain


[Chorus]
She's appalled
Oh, she doesn't love me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down

[Spoken Outro]
That was it
[Verse 1]
I've been watching you walk
I've been learning the way that you talk
The back of your head is at the front of my mind
Soon I'll crack it open just to see what's inside your mind

[Chorus]
Inside your mind

[Verse 2]
Maybe I will wait until you're fast asleep
Dreaming things I have the right to see
Maybe you are dreaming you're in love with me
The only option left is look and see

[Chorus]
Inside your mind
Inside your mind

[Verse 3]
I can show you the photographs of you getting on with life
I've had dreams where there's blood on you
All those dreams where you're my wife

[Outro]
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
[Intro]
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga

You've got to listen to the beat

'Til we see the break of day
Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system
There's no way you're gonna stop

Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger

I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger

I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger

I got a heartache (Heartache)
I'm in a dark place (Heartache)
Woah, oh (Can ya help me out?)
That's why (That's why)
You were my flashlight (Flashlight)
You were my last try (That's right)
Woah, oh (Can't help me now)


[Chorus]
Joe Blazey, when you met me, I was
Scared, baby, look how fast we're goin'
Good times, you made me think about 'em
All the time

[Segue: Dominic Fike &amp; Julian Cruz]
Sorry, I, I was literally just having a panic attack
Oh, okay, you okay?
Yeah
Alright, we're gonna head to the store
Alright
FaceTime me if you need anything
Okay
Have a good one

[Verse 2]
Trainwreck, I think I fell off (Trainwreck)
I'm goin' dark mode (Ayy, whoa, whoa, whoa)
In my hotel bar (Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa)
This shit is not coke (Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa)
And this is wells, dawg (Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Don't tell me, "Sit down" (Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'll burn a bitch down (Oh)
So crazy when you met me, I was
Just a baby, look how fast I'm goin'
Good times, you made me think about the good times
Ayy, ayy, yeah, mm, mm


[Chorus]
Joe Blazey, when you met me, I was
Scared, baby, look how fast we're goin'
Good times, you made me think about 'em
Good times

Yeah
Just know I'm not proud of everything I did so far
But I do it all for you

T-E-M-P
Farru!

[Pre-Coro: Farruko]
Baby, envíame tu location
Pero que sea con discretion
Que tu novio no se me entere
Que tú estabas hablando conmigo
Porque si fantasmea se muere

[Coro: Farruko &amp; Anuel AA]
Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chingas conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
Que no te esté llamando (no), dile que lo estoy buscando
Si lo pillo por ahí le mando (brrrr)

[Verso 1: Bryant Myers]
(Bryant Myers)
Siempre volvemo' a verno'
Tú pegándole cuerno'
Chingábamos to'a las veces que te dejaba sola
En las noches de invierno
Me cura cuando me enfermo
Pero tenemos que esconderno'
Yo quiero que tú me bailes como bailan
To'as las putas en el infierno, ah
Entro a la cabaña
Tú quieres champaña
Terminamos de hacerlo y me pide chingar
Otra vez cada vez que se baña
Una santa con él y conmigo se daña
Yo sé que to'as las cadenas él las baña
Dile a ese cabrón que tumbe la actitud
Y que deje las miradas extrañas


[Verso 2: Almighty]
(Almighty)
Siempre estoy online en WhatsApp
Esperando que un culo me escriba
Ella tiene un canal de YouTube
Modelando las nalgas pa' que me suscriba
Echamos tres polvos como las tres líneas de la combi Adidas
No quiere amarrarse (no)
Pero chicha conmigo y mañana se olvida, baby (wuh)
Tu marido anda a pie
Por eso me llama y me pide una ride
Enrola que tengo una moña más verde
Que Linterna Verde y botellas de Sprite
A tu jevo le pongo un checkmark en la cara
Con la 23 le hago el signo de Nike
Tengo a las putas de ustedes
Metidas en Instagram dándome like
Pónme el condón con la boca
Es má', no me lo pongas ya (no quiero)
Me dice que no me da el culo
Si no es en hoteles o en el Gran Meliá (cabrona)
Tengo muchas prepago'
Tengo chapiadoras que maman por trago
Y yo que les compro botellas
Imagínate, mi herma, to' lo que les hago (Almighty)


[Coro: Farruko/Anuel AA]
Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chingas conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
Que no te esté llamando, dile que lo estoy buscando
Si lo pillo por ahí le mando (brrrr)

[Verso 3: Tempo]
(T-E-M-P)
Ella dice que yo soy el único que le da escalofríos
Que esta noche ella está dispuesta a pegarle cuernos al marío'
Y me digo en la cara del bobo 'e tu esposo
Si yo me lo encuentro
"Lo bueno de estar con mujeres casadas
Es que yo me les vengo adentro"
Me he chingado a modelos cabronas, pero sigo discreto
No me gusta decir quiénes son
Pero dando candela, saben, no es secreto
Con muchas mujeres hermosas siempre me han vinculado
Maripily, Caroline Aquino, Vilmarie Mojica, Bebé Maldonado
Me he tirado a cinco Miss Universe porque estoy en la mía
Y hasta he puesto a mujeres famosas
A chuparse, lamberse y hasta a hacer orgías
Me le vengo en la boca, se pasa mi leche
Y me mira con cara 'e bellaca
La mando a Colombia, se hace las tetas
Yo soy el que leche le saca
No me importa si está mordío'
Ese culo es mío
Si él quiere problemas andamos bien aborrecíos'
No me importa si está mordío'
Ese culo es mío
Si él quiere problemas andamos bien aborrecíos'


[Coro: Farruko/Anuel AA]
Porque tú eres solo mía y él lo tiene que entender
Que solo chingas conmigo y aquí el cabrón es él
(Real Hasta La Muerte, ¿oíste, bebé?)
Que no te esté llamando (no), dile que lo estoy buscando
Si lo pillo por ahí le mando (brrrr)

[Verso 4: Anuel AA]
(Anuel)
Tú eres mi pistola y yo soy tu chip
Me siento como un demonio cuando estoy adentro 'e ti
Yo me echo tres Pelcos, te meto este bicho
Y te pongo a brincar, tú encima de mí
Mámame el bicho, bebé, en mi cuello tengo quince mil
Yo te pongo tus piernas en mis hombros
Chingamos y enrolo puré (puré)
Fumando puré tú me mamas el bicho
Y te exploto la boca a la vez (a la vez)
Mi pistola es fulete y mis peines son todos de dos dedos
Yo no tengo de diez (de diez, brrrr)
Chíngame como si yo voy a morirme mañana, diablita, otra vez
Ese cabrón te está llamando y nosotros estamos chingando
Yo te lambo ese totito y después te pongo en cuatro
Yo te muerdo las nalgas y me vengo en tu espalda
Medio kilo de mi cubana
Siéntante encima de este bicho
Como si yo fuera a morirme mañana

[Letra de "Ella Y Yo" ft. Don Omar]

[Intro: Don Omar &amp; Romeo Santos]
¡Don!
And another one, that's right
¡Don! (¡Don!)
Dominicans, boricuas, hands up (¡Don!, ¡Don!)
On your feet everybody, come on
No hay pa' nadie pa', y me fui con los bachatero'
Aventura
Nasty
Let me find out

[Verso 1: Don Omar &amp; Romeo Santos]
Ella y yo
Dos locos viviendo una aventura castigada por Dios
Un laberinto sin salida donde el miedo se convierte en amor
Somos su marido, ella y yo
Mi esposa y yo
Igual que ustedes, compartimos en la vida un eterno amor
La dama perfecta, toda una belleza, ella es mi inspiración
Somos feliz ella y yo, ella y yo
Amigo, ella y yo
Solos nos vemo' a escondidas para ahogar esta prohibida pasión
Y aunque tiene dueño, yo solo tengo un sueño: ser su protector
Somos marido, ella y yo


[Refrán: Romeo Santos &amp; Don Omar]
Oye Don, lucha por amor
No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quién es victima en la confusión
Oye mi pana, lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tú no sabes quién es victima en esta confusión

[Verso 2: Romeo Santos &amp; Don Omar]
Mi esposa y yo
Somos felices, dos almas matices, sé lo que es el amor
Por eso te entiendo y aunque sea casada, no te alejes por temor
No lo hagas, Don, ay, no-no-no
Mi amigo, ella y yo
Teníamos claro que era una locura esta relación
Pero la carne nos llamaba, y la cama nos hacía una invitación
A solo hacer el amor
Ay, ya te expliqué
Cuando hay personas que se aman, el amor tiene que vencer
Y que el marido entienda que perdió su hembra, ahora es tu mujer
No pueden ganar los tres

[Refrán: Romeo Santos &amp; Don Omar]
Y te repito, lucha por amor
¡No me aconsejes en tu posición!
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
Tú no sabes quién es víctima en esta confusión
No seas tan tonto, lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tú no sabes quién es víctima en esta confusión

Pa' to'a mi gente 'e Puerto Rico
¡Don! (¡Don!)

[Verso 3: Don Omar &amp; Romeo Santos]
Amigo, pido perdón, yo nunca te fallé
Me traicionaron las ganas de volverla a ver
Y aunque todavía no puedo creer
Lo que este amargo encuentro me hizo comprender
Pues tú también llegaste a ese lugar
Donde tantas veces yo la fui a buscar
Y aunque no es fácil lo que voy a hacer
Admitiré que salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
¿Qué?
Salí con tu mujer
No, yo no estoy creyendo esto, mano
Salí con tu mujer
No, no
Salí con tu mujer

[Verso 4: Romeo Santos]
Que te perdone Dios, yo no lo voy a hacer
Los perdí a los dos y a la misma vez
Ya veo que todo era mentira cuando ella me decía
Que se iba pa' Puerto Rico a vacaciones con su amiga, me mintió
Tú y ella en una cama, allá en Bayamón
Quizás en Isla Verde o Carolina, cuántos hoteles ensució
Tú también, los odio a los dos


[Outro: Don Omar &amp; Romeo Santos]
Amigo, entiende
Que yo soy quien más sufro con todo esto, me mata el dolor
Fue una traición
Perdí un amigo por la tentación
Perdón
Adiós
[Letra de "Quizás"]

[Refrán]
Buscando donde no hay nada
Ya no quiero discutir, ¿para qué seguir tratando con la ilusión
De que un día me quieras como yo quiero? Pero soy un juego
Tú en mí buscas venganza, yo en ti busco un sueño
Dime entonces qué hacemos

[Coro]
Quizás amaste a quien no debiste amar
Tomaste una decisión fatal
Te lastimaron y eso te hizo mal
Y yo lo tuve que pagar
Quizás él te engañó, no te amó de verdad
Fue una aventura, un juego y nada más
Nunca te dieron la oportunidad
Y yo lo tuve que pagar

[Verso 1]
Tú creyendo que me quieres
Yo queriéndote creer
Supo a verdad lo que sentimos
Aunque en el corazón no lo quisimos
¿Qué bien nos mentimo', eh?
Y del amor nadie se salva
¿Por qué engañarnos así?
¿Cómo obligarte a que me quieras?


[Coro]
Quizás amaste a quien no debiste amar
Tomaste una decisión fatal
Te lastimaron y eso te hizo mal
Y yo lo tuve que pagar
Quizás él te engañó, no te amó de verdad
Fue una aventura, un juego y nada más
Nunca te dieron la oportunidad
Y yo lo tuve que pagar

[Verso 2]
Sentí necesidad, cansado estaba ya
La pena más amarga me envolvió, quise saber llorar
Busqué la más fatal, hasta pensé en matar
El día en que más la quise, me dejó; perdí mi felicidad
Dicen que es cosa de tontos enamorarse, tener sentimientos
Amar hoy solo es cosa de un beso
Ya nadie se promete más allá del tiempo, nadie cree en lo eterno
Mi amor, pero por eso no tuvimos que ser igual

[Coro]
Quizás amaste a quien no debiste amar
Tomaste una decisión fatal
Te lastimaron y eso te hizo mal
Y yo lo tuve que pagar
Quizás él te engañó, no te amó de verdad
Fue una aventura, un juego y nada más
Nunca te dieron la oportunidad
Y yo lo tuve que pagar


[Refrán]
Buscando donde no hay nada
Ya no quiero discutir, ¿para qué seguir tratando con la ilusión
De que un día me quieras como yo quiero? Pero soy un juego
Tú en mí buscas venganza, yo en ti busco un sueño
Dime entonces qué hacemos

[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?


[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
And tonight I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (when I was young)
See me (too) wither
(when I was young)

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Know that (me) I've enjoyed the sunshine
When I was young, know it happens all— (me)
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine— (me)
Know it happens all (me) —all the time (me)
Know it happens all (me) —all the time (me)
When I was young (me, me)


[Outro Harmonizing: Jazmine Sullivan]

Slavy narodov nadezhnyj oplot!
Znamia sovetskoe, znamia narodnoe

Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish &amp; Khalid]
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

[Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

[Verse 2: Khalid with Billie Eilish]
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish &amp; Khalid]
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear


[Chorus: Billie Eilish with Khalid]
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

[Outro: Khalid, Billie Eilish, Khalid &amp; Billie Eilish]
Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home
[Verse 1: M. Shadows]
Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design

[Verse 2: M. Shadows &amp; The Rev]
Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Almost laughed myself to tears (Ahahaha)
Conjuring her deepest fears (Come here you fucking bitch)
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fucking deep in
It goes on and on, and on
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever


[Chorus: M. Shadows]
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
Baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

[Verse 3: M. Shadows &amp; The Rev]
Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it (Eat the shit out of it)
Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize
From somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever


[Chorus: M. Shadows]
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry

[Bridge: M. Shadows &amp; Juliette Commagere]
I will suffer for so long
(What will you do? Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again


[Verse 4: M. Shadows]
We're coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have a wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

[Segue: Z. Vengeance]
Do you take this man to death
For the rest of your unnatural life?
(Yes, I do)
Do you take this woman to death
For the rest of your unnatural life?
(I do)
I now pronounce you

[Chorus: M. Shadows &amp; The Rev]
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time but bye, bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart, at least for the most part
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah yeah
But baby don't cry
[Verse 1]
Hooray, I awake from yesterday
Alive but the war is here to stay
So my love, Katherina and me
Decide to take our last walk
Through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to be reborn
Away from a life so battered and torn
Forever, forever

[Verse 2]
Oh, say can you see, it's really such a mess
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick tube-shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the Arctic stains
From silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find the sand and the sea
Is straight ahead, straight up ahead

[Verse 3]
Well, it's too bad, that our friends can't be with us today
Well, that's too bad
"The machine that we built would never save us"
That's what they say
(That's why they ain't coming with us today)
And they also said
"It's impossible for man to live and breathe underwater forever"
Was their main complaint
(Yeah)
And they also threw this in my face, they said:
"Anyway, you know good and well
It would be beyond the will of God
And the grace of the King"
Grace of the King, yeah, yeah


[Verse 4]
So my darling and I make love in the sand
To salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine has done its work, played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under, we take a last look
At the killing noise of the out of style
The out of style, out of style


[Instrumental break 3:58-11:22]

[Verse 5]
So down and down and down and down
And down and down we go
Hurry, my darling, we mustn't be late for the show
Neptune champion games to an aqua world is so very dear
Right this way, smiles a mermaid
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer
Atlantis full of cheer
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer

[Instrumental outro 12:11-13:39]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
I lost my way, oh, baby, this stray heart
Went to another, can you recover, baby?
Oh, you're the only one that I'm dreaming of
Your precious heart was torn apart by me and you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not alone, oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

[Chorus]
Everything that I want, I want from you, but I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you, but I just can't have you

[Verse 2]
I said a thousand times and now a thousand one
We'll never part, I'll never stray again from you
This dog is destined for a home to your heart
We'll never part, I'll never stray again from you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not alone, oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

[Chorus]
Everything that I want, I want from you, but I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you, but I just can't have you


[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You're not alone, oh, and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone, oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

[Chorus]
Everything that I want, I want from you, but I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you, but I just can't have you
Everything that I want, I want from you, but I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you, but I just...
Just can't have you

I think it's time we blow this scene
Get everybody and the stuff together
Ok, three, two, one, let's jam!

[Instrumental]
運命なんて言えない
あと何センチ近付けば良いんだろう
君がいいと言えないまま見つめてる後ろ姿

余裕のない日々です
デートなんて自信がないな
君が眩しい程
僕は情けなくなってく

(会えない時間＋君が笑った瞬間)÷2のこのときめきと
不器用な僕×強がりな君は案外プラスかもって
気付いてしまったら最後

まだね運命なんて言えない
あと何センチ近付けばいいんだろう
僕は君に何をしてあげれるかな
あの日大丈夫って笑顔
あと何センチ先を歩いてんだろう
君がいいと言えば追いつけるのかな　届くのかな

ふとした瞬間に
君の寂しさを知ったんだ
弱い僕はほらね
離れられなくなっていく

(やっと来たチャンス＋いただけないこの会話)÷2で虚しくたって
不確かな今日×不安定な感情だからこそ僕は君を
見つけられたのかもしれない


だから運命だって信じたい
今数センチ近付いても良いかな
胸を裂くよ　振り向いてくれるたびに
君の笑顔も言葉も
もう何センチ　積もって消えやしない
綺麗事じゃ片付けられない程に想っている

運命だって言えるまで
笑ったように見せた君に届くまで
特別じゃない今の僕に出来ること

まだね運命なんて言えない
あと何センチ近付けば良いんだろう
僕は少し変わっていける気がする
辿り着いた時は君に
大丈夫だよ　僕が先に言うから
君が好きだ　終わらないこの想いが　届きますように
君のせい　君のせい　君のせいで私
臆病でかっこつかない
君のせいだよ

少し伸びた前髪に隠れてる君の目
ちょっとどこ見てんの？こっちに来て！
君が私を夢中にさせるのに難しい事は一つもない

夕方の駅のホーム　波の音
黙る私を見透かしたように
そんな風に笑わないで

君のせい　君のせい　君のせいで私
臆病でかっこつかない
こんなはずじゃないのに
君のせい　君のせい　君のせいで私
誰かを嫌いになるの？
こんな夜は胸騒ぎしかしないよ
ハートのマシンガン構えて
余裕ぶっこいてる君に狙い撃ちするのさ

今も少し痛む傷　隠してる
制服脱いだって見えやしないほんとのこころ
二人並んで歩いても微妙すぎる距離感
もっと近付いてよ


最低な言葉言ってみたりした
カワイソウな女の子ってやつに
ならないための予防線

君のせい　君のせい　君のせいで私
忘れられない事ばっか
増えていって困るなぁ
君のせい　君のせい　君のせいで今ね
私は綺麗になるの

君じゃなきゃ嫌だって言いたい　今すぐ
ひとりきりの夜とずっと　ここで待っていたんだよ

君のせい　君のせい　君のせいで私
臆病でかっこつかない
こんなはずじゃないのに
君のせい　君のせい　君のせいで私
誰かを嫌いになるの？
こんな夜は胸騒ぎしかしないよ
ハートのマシンガン構えて
余裕ぶっこいてる君に狙い撃ちするのさ
[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway
Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase
I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
I battle with depression, but the question still remains
Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage?
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular monster


[Verse 2]
I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace
I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace
How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste
Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention
I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing
And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave
I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again
Crashed my car just to feel again
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah


[Breakdown]
Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh
We're sick and tired of wondering
Praying to a god that you don't believe
You're searching for the truth in the lost and found
So the question I ask is, oh, where the fuck is your god now?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular monster

[Outro]
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
[Intro: Charli XCX]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
When he calls me, I go crazy
Call me with my friends, it doesn't phase me
Windows down, ridin' in the SUV
And I'm spillin' champagne all on my screen, screamin'
Wheels are screechin', hundred miles per hour
He like me 'cause I'm wild, camera phone in the shower
Ring-ring, gonna let it ring out
Sounds so good, wanna turn it up loud

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer


[Verse 2: Sarah Bonito]
KKB, AAC
Your ringtone could be anything
A barking dog, revved engine
Whatever catches your attention
It's your choice
Would you like to hear my voice?
Or is it hard to talk
When you're scared of where the call is coming from?

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Verse 3: Rico Nasty]
I think I might be addicted to your kisses
Lovestruck, baby, you're the piece I'm missin'
I know you're what I'm lookin' for and I'm so tired of wishin'
We can do it now or later, it don't make a difference
He sent me a text, says "See you when you get here"
I was lonely last week, but I won't be next year
Kiss me on my left cheek, love me like my bestie
On the phone with Ashley, run shit like an athlete
We be at the game, yeah, but we never play them
He could be in danger, I still wouldn't save him
I be in the front like Rudolph the Reindeer
I can tell you got a crush, that's the reason why you came here
You ain't gotta lie, just be honest with yourself
You wouldn't be here if it was for anyone else
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
And when he calls me, I don't come home


[Bridge: Sarah Bonito]
Throw away my phone, hide it somewhere no one knows
Buried it in the ground, so it can never be found
But I still hear it, I hear the sound of your ringtone
It's a crime, why can't I get you outta my mind?

[Interlude: Laura Les]
My boy's got—
Wait, Charli, can you sing the chorus again please?

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I— (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer


[Outro: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I—
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer
[Verse 1: Patrick Stump &amp; Craig Owens]
I was dying to find a way to kill time
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye
I was dying to find a way to kill time (A way to kill time)
Now you're gone and I can't ever say goodbye
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go, go, go, go

[Chorus: Nicole Dollanganger]
Oh my god, what the fuck?
Take my hand, crush it up
Spill the blood on the floor
I ain't scared, think there's more
What the fuck? Make it stop
Took too long, here right now
On the floor, in the air
Smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think
I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside
You made it your mission, yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one
But you just went and made it fun


[Verse 2: Craig Owens]
I hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
She's workin' in my mind
And you're lookin' for a way to crush
It's not enough
You fucked up your last try
We were in the studio, I was just playin'
You were all work and I was all play and
You were talkin' business, aiming with your weapon
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression

[Verse 3: Craig Owens]
I'll never go, I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words when you write at all
You'll just hear me singing this song
You'll think that's okay, you'll just sing along
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too

[Outro: Craig Owens]
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me too
I'd copy me too, copy me too
Copy me too, copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
[Verse 1]
All I need is a circle I can trust
Whoever leaves open eyes should see
Gives me more than just a reason to show I'm fine
And never have a reason to waste my time
And I'm open to the thought of getting by

[Chorus]
But then she goes, she goes by
In the corner of the sky
Like a seagull, she flies high
'Cause she's always on my mind

[Verse 2]
What if I could be somebody else?
'Cause lately I've been thinking way too much
I was hoping you could take me away for good
I never had a reason to say I should
But I'm open to the thought of getting by

[Chorus]
But then she goes, she goes by
In the corner of the sky
Like a seagull, she flies high
'Cause she's always on my mind
[Verse 1]
We played grown-up, drowned in bathtubs
But you never opened up and I never said enough
Thunder warnin' should've called it
But we never gave it up

[Chorus]
Now I know it wasn't right, wasn't right
We pretended to hold it when quiet
And we blamed it on the time, on the time, on the time
And we broke it when silent

[Verse 2]
Slept on floors of, angry mornings
But you never let me in, so I stopped wanting it

[Refrain]
Tearing every wall and breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule 'til all of me was yours
And pushing things aside, but nothing ever worked, worked

[Chorus]
Now I know it wasn't right, wasn't right
We pretended to hold it when quiet
And we blamed it on the time, on the time, on the time
And we broke it when silent


[Refrain]
Tearing every wall and breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule 'til all of me was yours
And pushing things aside, but nothing ever worked, worked

[Chorus]
Now I know it wasn't right, wasn't right
We pretended to hold it when quiet
And we blamed it on the time, on the time, on the time
And we broke it when silent
[Verse 1]
Feel enough, but you couldn't though
As you sat around a minute more
On to think what had brought it up
As he grabbed a kiss to win her love
You or I hush some pointers
And fall aside, I've been foiling it
All the while to rate your teeth

[Chorus]
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth

[Verse 2]
Fucks it up like he couldn't be
Off for leaving you at secondly
All the wrong fortune adding up
As he grabbed a kiss to brush it off
Who would I laugh and point at
If you were to be avoided
And all the while to hate your teeth

[Chorus]
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth


[Verse 3]
All the way back in to a throe
Relishing in all the undertow
For tonight holding her to he
As she grabbed a kiss so tenderly
Why am I all for leaving
When you're the one I'm deceiving
And all the while I've hated your teeth

[Chorus]
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I saw you at the band stand looking pretty slammed
Did you see me feeding all my drinks to Cam?
Probably not I guess, you were quite the mess

And that girl who tagged along there with you
I never caught her name but she seemed fucked up too
From where I sat she looked to be having fun
Keeping up with you, just like I used to

Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I'm sorry to have ditched out but I was pretty high
Heard from Leslie that on his stumble home
Nat was puking up all that beer she'd drunk

Though we didn't talk much how'd your evening go
You barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred hello
But I happened to see without even tryin'
How she laughed with you, just like I used to

Hey there bud, how'd it go last night?
I woke up to a pair of shoes I've not seen next to mine
Did you whisper as you crept in through the door
How you'd never done much like this before?

I was thinking back just the other day
Remember when we used to sneak out late to go and blaze
Seemed like loneliness was all we'd ever do
But now she's knowing you, just like I used to
[Verse 1]
I’ve been leaving your shampoo bottles
Over in the corner there
Sitting empty on the bathtub rail
Wishing they could wash your hair

Yeah, I keep em by that crumb of fancy soap
And your toothbrush at my bathroom sink
Your cell phone chargers still hanging from the wall
Haven’t chucked it all, like you'd think
Though you haven’t been around in weeks

[Verse 2]
I’ve run out of my Speed Stick, honey
So I have been using yours
It's frickin trash, all that organic hoo hah
From one of your health food stores

It is seemingly worsened everyday
All this shit of yours around my house
If I could’ve had it any other way
Then by now I would’ve chucked it out
But it seems to wanna stick around

[Chorus]
I’ve been leaving you in radio silence
Though I’d love to catch a pass
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby, how fucked is that?
And it’s all just so forgettable
Til I’m sitting with your stuff alone
Man, why can’t I just let it go?


[Verse 3]
I’ve been seeing that red Corolla parked out on the corner there
If it were yours, there’d be some hippie bullshit hanging from the rearview mirror

As I’m passing it every other day
I look in to see if this one’s yours
But the shape it’s in is giving it away
Yours is dented up and down the doors
Never wanted to see it more

[Chorus]
I’ve been leaving you in radio silence
Though I’d love to catch a pass
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby, how fucked is that?
And it’s all just so forgettable
Til I’m sitting with your stuff alone
Man, why can’t I just let it go?
[Verse 1]
Tip-tiptoes softly on the grass
But you won't find nothing there at all
And tip-tiptoes slowly on your hands
'Cause you can't walk out of this mess, no
Tip-tiptoes softly on the grass
But you won't find nothing there at all
And tip-tiptoes slowly on your hands
'Cause you can't walk

[Chorus]
It takes you to start, it's coming 'round and 'round again
And you are, and you are
It takes you to start, it's coming 'round and 'round again
And you are, and you are
It's you
Too

[Verse 2]
You ask for someone to help you
But no one cares enough to look up
You can't ask for someone to help you
If you don't care enough to look around you
You ask for someone to help you
And no one care enough to look up
You can't ask for someone to help you
If no one cares


[Chorus]
It takes you to start, it's coming 'round and 'round again
And you are, and you are
It takes you to start, it's coming 'round and 'round again
And you are, and you are
It's you
Too

[Bridge]
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes
Your tiptoes

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stare I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight


[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Outro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 1: Jake Bundrick]
Katy, don't cry, I know
You're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is
Letting go of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so

[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
And she'll say yes
Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best


[Verse 2: Derek Sanders]
You're all that I hoped I'd find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living
Is just taking breaths to stay
Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet
But I need it, so

[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
And she'll say yes
Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you, I'll be miserable at best


[Verse 3: Jake Bundrick]
And this will be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you and I can't speak
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong and
I miss the lips that made me fly, so

[Chorus: Derek Sanders and Jake Bundrick]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there and
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
And she'll say yes
Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable at best

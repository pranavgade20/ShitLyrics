All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
You got to lose to know how to win
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you
Sing with me sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Dream on dream on dream on
Dream yourself a dream come true
Dream on dream on dream on
Dream until your dream come through
Dream on dream on
Dream on dream on
Dream on dream on
Dream on
Sing with me sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
Now tell me the truth
Don't make me wait too long
You have to prove that I shouldn't move on
I'm sitting here watching the tick of the clock
I hear my own heartbeat I want it to stop
Doing next to nothing except breaking apart
And this tension just cuts to the bone
Get out or give me reason
Shut up I'll do it alone
And I won't waste another year sitting in here
I'm waiting for something more
So I'm just stuck here in the meantime
Waiting on the other line
Now tell me the truth
Don't make me wait too long
You have to prove that I shouldn't move on
Giving in is the price I pay
These words alone hurt enough to walk away
You think I hang on everything you say
And worst of all you're predictable
I really must be moving onward to something
I'm standing right here and I came from nothing
The harder you fall the more pain you can take
You love when the pressure just pulls me apart
You're fueling the fire it just won't stop
It keeps growing and burning and taking my world down in flames
You're breaking the ground that you walk on
No one around you is safe
Your thoughts are as loud as a shotgun
They keep blowing me away
Away away away
So we're just stuck here in the mean time
Waiting on the other line
So we're just stuck here on the meantime
Waiting on the other line
We are the shadows where darkness crawls
We are the slither underneath your feet
All my friends are creeps
We are the pain of the rotten tooth
Of every child with hallow loot
We are the snake in your kitten's tree
All my friends are creeps
Some with horns and some with fangs
A hundred eyes and giant brains
From the depths of the cosmic sea
All my friends are creeps
We are the fly in your baby food
Monsters of the foulest mood
We haunt every house and dream
All my friends are creeps
It's noisy off the set path
How can I make choices I've yet to discover we have?
Must need rehab
If you think you know me from the facets they show these folks to get money I gotta laugh
How funny it is you don't realize the skill lies in knowing within the truth there's still lies
It's called being civilized
I am who you see
What you hear is part of me
But there's so much more to me
So much more to be than just alive
A son a brother a husband a father
But still can go even farther
Wish and will can go harder
In that time I went the hardest
More than this generic term "artist"
A reality smith you love my craftsmanship
Because I craft some shit to make my people proud
And so I speak aloud but not loud enough yet
Or as loud as I can get
They think I ain't a threat
But all preconceived notions I've arrived
To Offset
Jordan sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit and I wasn't rich I had no workplace
I missed the first years of your life I'm sorry
Tell the truth I ain't really know if I was your father
Tell the truth I really don't even know your mama
But I had to step up my daddy had left us
Even though we gotta catch up pray to God that he bless us
Had a baby as a kid mama kicked me out
Then I got caught for the shit in the pen when she pushed you out
Your mama tried to push me down ain't let me stay at the house
Jordan sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit and I wasn't rich I had no workplace
I'm a father of four gotta get that cash gold
Keep my past closed 'member I ain't had no dough
Not two not three all four that's all they know
Gotta thank your mama she hold me like holsters
Gotta protect her from the world I can't even post her
Ups and downs in this fame roller coaster
If I don't ball then everything 'round me fall
Jordan sorry I wasn't there for all your birthdays
I tried to hit and I wasn't rich I had no workplace
Me me I be so on fire
Me me cannot stand a liar said
Meet me when the sun grow tired they like why you so quiet who me me me?

I'm too tired to be bored I'm too bored to be tired
And the silence is so deafening it's like picking at a sore
I'm too mental to go crazy I'm too drunk to be pure

I don't wanna hear it anymore

Arguing with my dad and he said "It ain't Christ-like"

What is it you're waiting for?
You've got a chance to say it all
Cornered by your self-obsession
And suddenly you're sober
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're sober
What is it you're waiting for?
You've got a chance to say it all
Get your kicks from someone else
Don't look at me
Take your time and tell me what you're thinking
Just 'cause someone says it's over
With their head upon your shoulder
And suddenly you're sober
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're sober
Just 'cause someone says it's over
With their head upon your shoulder
And suddenly you're sober
All the things I wanna show you
Don't have the time to go through
It's like I'd never known you
And suddenly we're sober
Where is your heart? Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders break the walls together as one?
We have just proved that they can pollute our heads with the news
They will manipulate the masses again
If you gonna accuse me of tellin' you what you already knew
It's the same song sung with a different truth
And all of us forget it 'cause our head's inside the noose
They will manipulate the masses again
Yeah yeah yeah we won't forget it
You better pray for absolution
You can change but you can't deny
The new wave in a terror nation
Why do we ignore the warning signs?
Board it up the borders are shut
The blood of the innocent is under the rug
White lies in a world corrupt
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Where is your heart? Can we beat this if we all
Tear the borders break the walls together as one?
Are we all alone?
Hope widows shattered windows
Restriction without effect
Deadlines in silhouettes
Why do we ignore the warning signs?
Cold calls to derelict homes
Needles at the side of the road
Wires and liars like thorns that won't let go
Are we too blind to see through honest eyes?
War will cease when we refuse to fight
Tell me where is your heart?
I think the silence speaks volumes
Now we march to our own drums
They're only singing what they want to be sung
Hate's become the new anthem
How could you?
When did our veins run numb?
The longer I live I learn that we don't belong
We've taken more than we can give
And you'd do better on your own
The longer I live I learn that we don't belong
We've taken more than we can give
And you'd do better better on your own
Are we all alone?
Tear the borders break the walls take us back to when we're all
Together as one taught to love born to live and let go
Tear the borders break the walls take us back to when we're all
Together as one taught to love born to live and let go
I was walking through desert
The wind across my face
The heat upon my back
Tell me how I got here
I hope this is a dream
Things are getting crazy
Time it sped by
As I moved across the space
A flash before my eyes
And then gone without a trace
Like lightning through the sky
I traveled through the air
And was placed upon a rock
Overlooking what was there
I was brought into a castle
It was filled with many treasures
That hung along the halls
And I stood before a King
With a crown upon his head
And he looked me in the eyes
And then this is what he said
He said I was out my head I was out of control
Sometimes you crash and you burn
Before you're once again whole
Gather the pieces to the puzzle
Said I was out my head I was out of control
With things that destroy your soul
Gather the pieces to the puzzle
I stared straight at this man and I noticed something strange
Upon his withered hand there was written down a name
My mind began to open and I began to see
But how did I get here and who had made me king
And who had build this castle and placed me in thing
He said none of that now matters
But learn from what I speak
Then gently pulled me closer as he was growing weak
And said I was out my head I was out of control
Sometimes you crash and you burn
Before you're once again whole
Gather the pieces to the puzzle
Said I was out my head I was out of control
With things that destroy your soul
Gather the pieces to the puzzle
I was out my head I was out of control
Sometimes you crash and you burn
Before you're once again whole
Gather the pieces to the puzzle
Said I was out my head I was out of control
With things that destroy your soul
Gather the pieces to the puzzle
Responsible night for a polite fellow
Proceed with tequila shots with a dish full of cold limes
The whole nine laughing remembering all the old lines
Never used to work but I could 'em give another try
I've had a hard week I deserve to get sauced
Pick up another round as my friends depart and
They may not stick around but I just got started
Feel so much better than usual
I feel indisputable oh
I think that I might be beautiful
Spend like God put on airs to sell it
Crowd pretends not to care but I know they're jealous
Zero to sixty I can turn on a dime I'm hitting bottom
And I'm feeling like committing a crime
Sorry was I saying something?
Is it hair of the dog if you stay drunk and don't stop at all?
Another night losing it more than I can afford
Was I just feeling bored? Am I that insecure?
Feel so much better than usual
I feel indisputable oh
But now I'm feeling so beautiful
I know that I will be ugly when
I feel like myself again oh
But now I'm feeling so beautiful
Bottle of Scotch served on the rocks with a shot of Cachaca
Vodka Sake kamikaze with a handle of Sherry
A cherry Brandy with a Jaeger chaser Champagne float
A Bourbon hot Toddy in teacup of throat coat
Martini Bellini Negroni Baileys Kahlua Sambuca
Tequila Manhattan a Margarita Old Fashioned
Dry Vermouth and something I can't taste 'cause I'm so trashed
Soldiering over I'm slower shoulder to shoulder with no one
Stumbling sobering making friends with a smoker
I know I'm less than upright losing the fight with the ground
Then someone hits the lights as they close for the night now
Try to look at Heaven and I can't see the stars
A billion trillion eyes are winking as I walk between parked cars
Metabolizing liquor while I'm losing my friends
I'm gonna hate myself tomorrow then I'll do it again
Feel so much better than usual
I feel indisputable oh
But now I'm feeling so beautiful
I know that I will be ugly when
I feel like myself again oh
My vision is blurry as long as I'm thirsty
Nobody can hurt me hurt me hurt me
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come
One sip bad for me
One hit bad for me
One kiss bad for me
But I give in so easily
I should stay strong
But I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
No thank you
They call me after dark I don't want no part
My habits they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge
One sip bad for me
One hit bad for me
One kiss bad for me
But I give in so easily
I should stay strong
But I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
We we fall for that
Wake up we fall again
We we fall for that
Can't wait to fall again
One sip bad for me
One hit bad for me
One kiss bad for me
But I give in so easily
I should stay strong
But I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak
But I'm weak and what's wrong with that?
Boy oh boy I love it when I fall for that
Is this metal enough for you?
Is it heavy enough destructive enough?
Am I bloody enough?
Can somebody tell me
Am I the top of the bottom
Or the bottom of the top?
Yeah
Is this empty enough for you?
Is it ugly enough destructive enough?
Am I angry enough for you?
Your time is up don't give a fuck
Am I bloody enough?
Am I fucking enough?
Can somebody tell me
Am I the top of the bottom
Or the bottom of the top?
Long live the fallen idols
All moths into the flame
You're chasing your own shadows
Are you not entertained?
Long live the fallen idols
All moths into the flames
You're chasing your own shadow
Are you not entertained?
Can somebody tell me
Am I the top of the bottom?
Can somebody tell me
Am I the top of the bottom
Or the bottom of the top?
Top
Bottom of the top
Yeah bottom
Yeah bottom of the top
If all the clouds become our enemies
And the rain begins to fall
And the rain begins to fall
Would you still be there standing next to me
With our backs against the wall
With our backs against the wall
But darling when the sky is dark
I still see it clearly
I see you
Even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close
And whenever I walk too far
Honey there's no easy part
No matter what you're told
But even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close
For all the times we've had our differences
And the tears began to fall
And the tears began to fall
We've always made it too the final step
To look back at it all
God damn we've seen it all
But darling when the sky is dark
I still see it clearly
I see you
Even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close
And whenever I walk too far
Honey there's no easy part
No matter what you're told
But even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close
Even when we're miles apart
I'll still hold you close
And whenever I walk too far
Over in the corner there
Sitting empty on the bathtub rail
And your toothbrush at my bathroom sink
Your cell phone chargers still hanging from the wall
So I have been using yours
From one of your health food stores
It is seemingly worsened everyday
All this shit of yours around my house
But it seems to wanna stick around
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby how fucked is that?
Yours is dented up and down the doors
Never wanted to see it more
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby how fucked is that?
Lyrics from Snippet
Bad timing stars aligning
Bad timing stars aligning
They don't wanna see me win crucify the kid
Lost in my head yeah losing my brain
Everybody out to get me they're abusing my brain
Even when I'm doing drugs shit it don't feel the same
Uh beautiful uh incredible pain
No matter how hard I try can't get other people to change
She still got a lot to learn so do I so it's okay
You ain't right all the time neither am I
You're the only that can convince me that I won't die
You end my movie happily I'm out that Nicolas Cage
Hey you little piss baby
You think you're so fucking cool? Huh?
You think you're so fucking tough?
You talk a lotta big game for someone with such a small truck
Aw look at those arms
Your arms look so fucking cute they look like lil' cigarettes
I bet I could smoke you I could roast you
And then you'd love it and you'd text me "I love you"
And then I'd fucking ghost you
With the big boys coming with the big stuff
I feel so clean like a money machine oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine oh yeah
Big boys coming with the picture
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Said it all before and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone
Said it all before and I'll say it once again
I'm better off alone
With the big boys coming with the big stuff
I feel so clean like a money machine oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine oh yeah
Big boys coming with the big trucks
Feel so clean like a money machine oh yeah
Big boys coming with the picture
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Feel so clean like a money machine
Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours
Where did you go?
I should know but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life
Hurry I'm worried
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die not by mistake
So where did you go?
I should know but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Even if it's just a lie
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to
Hurry I'm worried
Where did you go?
I should know but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like to be hated
To be fated to telling only lies
But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings
Like I do and I blame you
No one bites back as hard on their anger
None of my pain and woe can show through
But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
Discover L I M P say it
Discover L I M P say it
Discover L I M P say it
Discover L I M P say it
Discover
No one knows what it's like to be mistreated
To be defeated behind blue eyes
No one knows how to say that they're sorry
And don't worry I'm not tellin' lies
But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man behind blue eyes
I wish there was a situation to be mad at
Or a person I could blame
I've got a loud mouth I'm pale with a ghost obsession
There's gotta be a reason
You keep your guy in hiding
I'm becoming what I've hated
But your talk is so inviting
But then what?
You drop your guy and take me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?
My mood's dictated by our conversations
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
I never have to
Carefully shape sentences
When I've got some words to say
They're falling from my mouth from the time
That they hit my brain
'Cause we built a picture made for frames
We live in chemistry away from all the wasted time and taste
But then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?
My mood's dictated by our conversations
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
We built a picture made for frames
We live in chemistry away from all the wasted time and taste
And it sucks to sleep
'Cause you aren't talking to me
I wanna give you space
But the amount between us is wrecking me
But then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?
'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?
'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Am I in his position now?
'Cause then what?
You dropped your guy and took me on
It's everything I wanted
But then what?
Would you get tired of my time?
My mood's dictated by our conversations
And if you don't text I get too frustrated
Conflicted looks good on me
I'm trying desperately
I'll forget you if you need me to
Like nothing ever happened
My sun still sets without you
Like nothing ever happened
And I know that you're the one that's speaking through her
Miriam can you hear me??"
"I am alive inside your wife
"I am alive inside your wife
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
Too much to bear
You were my life but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
There's just no time to die
No time to die mmm
No time to die ooh
Fool me once fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
There's just no time to die
Open up my window head floats out the door
No one else around the shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head blinded by the sky
Moves away so fast fall down to the ground
I know there's more to come jump back to my feet
I think you know the reason why
Sometimes the going gets so good
Then again it gets pretty rough
But when I have you in my arms baby
You know I just can't I just can't get enough
I think you I think you know the reason why
I saw a blind man standing on the corner yesterday baby
He couldn't hardly tie his shoes
But he had a harmonica and a guitar strapped around his neck and he sure could
He sure could play the blues
I think you know the reason why
I feel like I've seen just about a million sunsets
She said if your with me ill never go away
That's when I stopped and took another look at my baby
She said if your with me ill never go away
Before you know the reason why
I had a dream the other night baby
I dreamt that I was all alone
But when I woke up I took another look around my self
And I was surrounded by fifty million strong
I think you know the reason why
Anime thighs when she open up so wide I got a twinkle in my eye
Anime thighs when she open up so wide I got a twinkle in my eye
Why you act like you retarded? Like lil' bitch I don't want drama
Asian penis is too tiny like it was a no show
Yeah your sister is my groupie she take this anime dick
Okay okay like little bitch I don't care if that fat ass is 2D
Score a bounty on that pussy you can call me Spike Lee
And if you got some shit to say then you can say it to me
Anime thighs when she open up so wide I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight I just really wanna pipe
Anime thighs when she open up so wide I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight I just really wanna pipe
Can you just give me head? Please just get on your knees
Bitch I'll beat up that ass like my name is Bruce Lee
Asian people driving are they even trying?
Thick thighs look sexy even when especially she decides to wear her dress
Man I love my body pillow especially givin' head
Anime thighs when she open up so wide I got a twinkle in my eye
Asian pussy is so tight I just really wanna pipe
Oh my God she got them big ass titties she's only five
Forget my jealousy
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said
"We own the night"
Stomp that feeling your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this well I grew stupid
Say accidents happen it's admirable acting
Separate is the way though no second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business your plaque on my wall
Let your hair down have one more round drink 'til you believe it
Sloppy kisses dirty wishes baby this is living
Roller coaster up and down in random motion
Oh come in closer ditch your problems better days are coming
Get up off the wall come on get down get down
Give into the moment and live now live now
Get up off the wall come on get down get down
Give into the moment feel it now
I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night
Stomp that feeling your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this well I grew stupid
Say accidents happen it's admirable acting
Separate is the way though no second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business your plaque on my wall
Call your phone and open up my fate
'Cause I know you're so connected
I need poison mitigate my pain
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Tranquilize and modify my brain
Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do the thrill is gone
So I play these nervous songs
And medicate medicate medicate me all night long
Medicate medicate medicate me all night long
I run quickly out of air
By the way I hate your celebration
I run quickly out of air
By the way I hate our aging faces
When I was a young boy my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said "Son when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken the beaten and the damned?"
He said "Will you defeat them? Your demons
Because one day I'll leave you a phantom
When I was a young boy my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said "Son when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken the beaten and the damned?"
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all the rise and fall the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone we want you all to know
We'll carry on we'll carry on and though you're
Dead and gone believe me your memory will carry on
We'll carry on and in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call
To carry on we'll carry on and though you're
Dead and gone believe me your memory will carry on
We'll carry on and though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
Take a look at me 'cause I could not care at all
Because the world will never take my heart
We want it all we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here because it's who we are
I'm just a man I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man I'm not a hero
We'll carry on we'll carry on and though you're
Dead and gone believe me your memory will carry on
We'll carry on and though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
Because the world will never take my heart
Ich schick sie nach Afghanistan ab in den Irak
Life filled with vanity
Colors have faded
Things you desire exist here
Flee from this colorless world
What shall I do?
Pieces I had have fell apart
Where do you belong?
Where should I aim for?
Once you've lost sight it's left to fall apart
Let's start it over again
Rebuild and combine all the pieces we have lost
To become one like a puzzle
Take it one at a time
When I stopped a rusted chain tangled me up
Tying my body onto the ground
As I sink underground I call your name
What can I do to see the day light once more?
Tear it apart and rip it off
Break the chain now
Sink down or swim up
Fight your way through
Seek your way out
If you can not you are left to drown deep inside
Chain tangled me harder choking my neck
Misery is nothing
It is all up to your thoughts
And beliefs to bring in success within your life
Don't you compare yourself with other people
That's a waste of person you are so why not be honest to your emotion
All the promises made between us
Broke in pieces and turned into sand
Let's escape from this colorless world to find myself
And tomorrow that we live
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Yeah I don't wanna fall asleep I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness you've been praying for my health
'Cause yeah we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married start a family watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
Happy you were mine it sucks that it's all ending
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'm happy that you here with me I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets sing me sound asleep
Sundays went to church on Mondays watched a movie
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
I'm not so perfect

Cotton candy skies
Always on my mind
When I think of you
I caught you like the flu
With my outstretched hands
Wish I had a chance
I'm stuck in this chair
You're like the moon
I'm chasing after you
Are you just a phase
I pray its not this way
Cotton candy skies
Always on my mind
When I think of you
I caught you like the flu
Cotton candy skies
Always on my mind
When I think of you
I caught you like the flu
Told you how I feel
Were you even real
Miss you so dam much
I'm banking on my luck
Breathing in and out
Why can't I see straight
My mind switching lanes
I'm trapped in my own brain
Through drought and famine natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
None of that could ever make me leave
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
And when we're making love uh
Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need between those thighs
Every time I look into your eyes I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
Oh yeah oh yeah babe
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you you
Before it winds down into
Now
Don't you love when I come around
Build you up then I take you down
Don't you love when I come around
Oh yeah oh yeah babe
This feels like summer
Boy you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck" don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts now they swear we was cool
Real bitch only thing fake is the boobs
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Talking crazy on your name trying not to catch a case
I came here to ball is you nuts?
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
They remind me of my pussy bitches mad tight
They say I'm too that oh I'm too this
Man I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Yeah but I get up ten
We gon' win
Yeah I said we gon' win

Thought I found a way
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely all alone
Heart made of glass my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces skin to bone
Hello welcome home
Walking out of time
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely all alone
Heart made of glass my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces skin to bone
Hello welcome home
Yeah ah
Hello welcome home
Thought I found a way
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh I hope some day I'll make it out of here

Tear me to pieces skin to bone

Heart made of glass my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces skin to bone
Hello welcome home

Hey leave a message
Hey call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this

"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
I'm not your party favor
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
Like you mishear all my songs
You just want what you can't have
No way
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way

So paint a target on my back let 'em come for me
I don't fall don't quit don't ever sleep
If you seek forgiveness
You will never know it's the price I pay
Look into my eyes we are not the same
Yeah this is where you fall apart

'Cause I gave my life gave it everything
Yeah this is where you fall apart

So I had this dream it meant everything and I watched it come alive
Then I let you in underneath my skin and I learned to love the lies
Now I lay awake and I contemplate have I become what I hate?
Can I take it back? 'Cause it's all I have will it get the best of me?
Have you ever had a dream? Would you fight for it?
Would you go to war? Would you die for it?
So now I'll take my stand now I'll make you see
To everybody who doubted to everybody who doubted
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and bow down bow down bow down
Ab tum hi ho
Ab tum hi ho
Ab tum hi ho
Whenever life gets you down Mrs Brown
And things seem hard or tough
And people are stupid obnoxious or daft
And you feel that you've had quite enough
Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour
That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second so it's reckoned
A sun that is the source of all our power
The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
Are moving at a million miles a day
In an outer spiral arm at forty thousand miles an hour
Of the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way'
Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars
It's a hundred thousand light years side to side
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light years thick
But out by us it's just three thousand light years wide
We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point
We go 'round every two hundred million years
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe
The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
In all of the directions it can whizz
As fast as it can go at the speed of light you know
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is
So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure
How amazingly unlikely is your birth
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space
The main character of the manga said
"I will protect you"
They were a really cool main character
Without making one unpleasant face smiling crying in the shadows
They fought they saved them
If it were me I'd cling to and depend on the main character
I just waited for the morning without doing anything alone on my bed
While drinking a cup of soup
While watching the same old news again in front of the television
I waited again for the usual peace
Just once just once just once just once
Give me proof that I'm here
Only me only me only me only me
Give me proof there's something only I can do
Even you it's the same everybody is waiting
I'm singing probably because even I don't know what that is
I hated things that took care simplicity was best
But for some reason the guitar in my room
Just a little just a little just a little just a little
I wanted even a square meter where I belonged
Only me only me only me only me
I wanted to be someone's number one
It won't change It won't change
Cause just as I thought this is how I am
Just a little just a little just a little just a little
I wanted even a square meter where I belonged
Just once just once just once just once
Give me proof that I'm here
Only me only me only me only me
Give me proof there's something only I can do
Love me
Forgive me
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
Knock knock let the devil in
Wicked I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Volkswagen tailspin bucket matches my pale skin
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
I said knock knock let the devil in
Cocked fuck around and catch a hot one
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills fuck up the track
Like what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Into ya the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed much as my rear fender assassin
Translation I will probably kill us both
Venom adrenaline momentum
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
I said knock knock let the devil in
On this game will end I'm loco
Became a Symbiote so
My fangs are in your throat ho
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Tire thumper a garrote tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire juggernaut
Why the fuck not you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

Baby
You try to run me through
Hold on think again
Don't you know what you're starting?

Seems like it crept up out of nowhere all around
You're done in by the time it's hit you
Your last surprise
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
You think you got your game
Planned out to a T
Yet I'm two steps ahead yeah
So you step into my way
Stand down it's a trap
One more step and you're dead
Why just a picosecond ago
Clear blue skies
But now lightning's struck your last resolve
It's not an accident that no one hears your cries
As your last strength seems to dissolve
You're done in by the time it's hit you your last surprise
I'm coming for you
My game's always so fast so fine
You're spun in
By the net you didn't catch it in time
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Better think about your game
Are you sure your next move is the right one for you?
Are you sure you won't get outmaneuvered
Again and again my friend?
You're done in
By the time it's hit you your last surprise
I'm coming for you
My game's always so fast so fine
You're spun in
By the net you didn't catch it in time

Gali gali hundi teri

Cynically Sane Par Lyrically Criminal
Put In The Effort And I Waited So Long
Waking Up Everyday Motivated To Rake Up A Storm
Invade The Nation With The Bars That Be Made Of Napalms
These Heads Of Programming Just Stutter And Hide
Yeh Saare Ke Saare They Trying To Teach Me
They Just Wanna Dance Now
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn
Yeah yeah
I don't give a damn
I don't give a damn
Being an artist being me
That was my best excuse for being crazy
Did you ever believe yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
One life here to foster no time here to squander
For the prize on offer we divide and we conquer
Gotta be more to life than sort of like every morning rise and shine
I wanna see all the lights on tour life then immortalised in time
All that glitters ain't gold what's royal is loyalty shown to your fam
Slow dance with the devil he asked for my signature written in blood
But yo will I be judged on the good and the bad that I've done in my life?
Did you ever believe yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
And I
Do you wanna take my hand? Do you wanna dance in the middle of the street like me?
Get a bit of free in me dive deep sightseeing the earth on cloud nine
Dreaming free as a bird try to focus when the scenery blurs
Bringing life into this world's like bringing a grain of sand to the beach but
Thing is that this little girl's like ten point five grams of you and me love
You ever think there's a link when we pass on? She might have passed on five and a quarter
Immortalised I thought that I had everything I wanted
It all was lies there's more to life couldn't put my finger on it
Apparent when you stare into her eyes and she got a pair like you
Did you ever believe yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Did you ever believe yeah
This life owes you more than you have?
Everybody go
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see for you to see
Save some face you know you've only got one
Change your ways while you're young
Oh girl he'll help you understand
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Looking back at sunsets on the East side
We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things slide by so carelessly
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
And someone is calling my name
From the back of the restaurant
And someone is playing a game
In the house that I grew up in
And someone will drive her around
Down the same streets that I did
On the same streets that I did
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it
Oh no oh no no no
Oh no oh no no no
Made myself a little garden
To grow myself my only friends
Got myself a brand new start and
Oh no I screwed it up again
In my mind but out of sight
I'm to blame for this
I hide away until the day is through
I will pay for this
Won't find a way to push the blame on you
I won't run from this
Hide away until the day is through
I found a plot of weeds instead
Yesterday was so adoring
My god so easy to offend
I would rather fly than fight
Close my eyes and hang on tight
I'm not to blame for this
I hide away until the day is through
I will run from this
I'll find a way to push the blame on you
I'll be alright tomorrow
Hide away until the day is through
It's so simple
It's as easy as it can be
Make a monster
Lock it up throw away the key
In the backyard
Buried deep underneath the tree
There's a monster
Taking root in the property
In the garden
Where the weeds are now growing free
In the garden
Where my friends plot to bury me
There's a jungle
It's as far as the eye can see
Overgrown now
It's no longer a fantasy
But it's too late
By the time that I realize
I can't see now
'Cause the dirt is up to my eyes
Long ago just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
Well I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
Well I've been holding on tonight
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
When both our cars collide
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Turn away if you could get me a drink
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded
Call my Aunt Marie help her gather all my things
And bury me in all my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers still I will not kiss you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Now turn away 'cause I'm awful just to see
'Cause all my hair's abandoned all my body
Oh my agony know that I will never marry
But counting down the days to go it just ain't living
And I just hope you know
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
Mama we all go to hell
Mama we all go to hell
I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
Mama we all go to hell
Oh well now Mama we're all gonna die
Mama we're all gonna die
Stop asking me questions I'd hate to see you cry
Mama we're all gonna die
And when we go don't blame us yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us yeah
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go
And when you go don't return to me my love
Mama we're all full of lies
Mama we're meant for the flies
And right now they're building a coffin your size
Mama we're all full of lies
Well mother what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
If you could coddle the infection they can amputate at once
And when we go don't blame us yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us yeah
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go
She said "You ain't no son of mine
For what you've done they're gonna find
A place for you and just you mind your manners when you go
Mama we all go to hell
Mama we all go to hell
It's really quite pleasant except for the smell
"And if you would call me a sweetheart
But there's shit that I've done with this fuck of a gun
And if you can stay then I'll show you the way
So raise your glass high for tomorrow we die
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
Then kill a woman with many children? Makes you a chump
Think about the people who own it for 'bout a second
I know you got your problems but brother they got theirs
This is not a game quit violence and grow a pair
But sure you'd rather hear me say "Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races grow hatred and form irrelevant
Damage 'em lives blown oblivion all cold oblivious
Auction 'em don't you bark at 'em murder 'em never heard of 'em
Give death another one uncle cousin brother son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of innocence
But in a sense innocent will soon behold the ignorance
We see I see death before the children
Gangster and a baller baby â€…I do what I want to
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to
Got a lot to lose still can't be scared to take it there
I was in them slums shit get dreadful like some Haitian hair
I come from that zoo it's just cobras pigs and apes in there
Ain't no second chances in this shit so we can't play it fair
Lil Hop Out he stay on go bitch all he know is green light
Let off shots with accuracy showed 'em what that beam like
Used to wake up in low income now I live a dream life
Gangster and a baller baby I do what I want to
I be with some steppers I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to
Bury me like a pharaoh with this money and my gold too
Keep a shooter in there try to rob me this the wrong tomb
I hit Johnny Dang and mixed the diamonds with the gold tooth
The FN sing a song like it's the leader of a soul group
Don't come 'round here like we friends you know I don't know you
You know I got demons allow me to show you
Been a while since I had to dial from a trap phone
See you later alligator quite a while crocodile we gone
Pray to God that my money stay long
Gangster and a baller baby I do what I want to
I be with some steppers I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to
Mmm num ba de

Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people people on streets

People on streets
Ee da de da de da de da
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher high
Pressure on people people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why why why?
Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love give love give love?
Because love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
I just pretend that I'm in the dark

It would be so awesome it would be so cool
It would be the most incredible superhero movie the world has ever seen
The screens would light up with real explosions and special effects
Like tons and tons of special effects
My super sweet cape would be special effects
And it would blow your mind
'Cause it's my movie my movie my superhero movie
It's all about me yeah it's all about me
It's my movie my movie my superhero movie
No longer a sidekick no that's not me
Picture my booty up in 3-D
I'll shake my booty in my own movie
It's my movie my movie my superhero movie
They'll be linin' up to see a movie all about me
I have the most impressive cool and scary
Mean and hairy adversary
But not to worry I'm the man in charge
Yeah I'd have an alter ego I'd be a billionaire
'Cause it's my movie my movie my superhero movie
It's all about me yeah it's all about me
It's my movie my movie my superhero movie
They'll be linin' up to see a movie all about me
Oh and I have my own hero music too

They'll be linin' up to see a movie all about me
It's my movie my movie my superhero movie
It's all about me yeah it's all about me
It's all about me
Every day I imagine a future where I can be with you
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
But in this world of infinite choices
What will it take just to find that special day?
What will it take just to find that special day?
Have I found everybody a fun assignment to do today?
When you're here everything that we do is fun for them anyway
When I can't even read my own feelings
What good are words when a smile says it all?
And if this world won't write me an ending
What will it take just for me to have it all?
Does my pen only write bitter words for those who are dear to me?
Is it love if I take you or is it love if I set you free?
The ink flows down into a dark puddle
How can I write love into reality?
If I can't hear the sound of your heartbeat
What do you call love in your reality?
And in your reality if I don't know how to love you
I'll leave you be
Befriend a bastard a thief as your brother
Heard him say what's yours is mine
Careful when gouging yourself with what's holy
I see through your transparent lies
Skeleton symphonies play psalms to tell you
Your venom has blinded your eyes
Make sure your rope is real strong when you hang me
Better make sure that I die
Your name became Judas the moment I helped you
If Mammon's the reason for killing your hero
Choke on your evil disguise
I really hate you
Stop getting in my way
I've lost my patience
When are you gonna decay?
I want to throw you out
Just like my broken TV
Hope this is what you desire
It's almost over
Why can't you just let it fly?
Don't be afraid
Your mechanical parts click
Sounds like when I broke your bones
Once I get my second chance
I won't leave you alone
Hope this is what you desire
Fang mal an
To have your babies
And wash your swollen feet
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
I tried to stop but I can't stop
I just can't stop thinking about her
Wanna hold your hand make you my girl
Light up light up my world
Wanna hold your hand make you my girl
Light up light up my world

It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Ring around the rosy
I never know I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy I want to give you want to give you
What you need
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Who ever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys will you let me stay?
Don't want to leave this play date with you

You always wanted to be
Part of a circus company
For the fun and death defying
But in time you forgot
Life is small in the big top
And your dreams were slowly dying
What you wanted
Was not a crime
Now you're always just a little a little in the middle
A little in the middle of where you're bound
Always just a little in the middle
It keeps your head from spinning round
Jugglers walk on the wire
Lions leap through hoops of fire
As the acrobats go flying
But what's the show all about?
When did your north get turned to south?
And the truth turn to lying?
What you wanted
Was not a crime
But you needed time
Now you're always just a little a little in the middle
A little in the middle of where you're bound
Always just a little in the middle
It keeps your head from spinning round
It keeps your head from spinning
But it's a hole you're digging
A hole you're digging you're doing it despite
There so much more you're missing
More you're missing to your left and to your right
Now you're always just a little a little in the middle
A little in the middle of where you're bound
Always just a little in the middle
It keeps your head from spinning round
Oh oh oh oh oh
It keeps your head from spinning round
And round and round
It keeps your head from spinning round
And round and round
It keeps your head from spinning
Cut me open and tell me what's inside
Diagnose me 'cause I can't keep wondering why
And no it's not a phase 'cause it happens all the time
Start over check again now tell me what you find
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
It's like an avalanche I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
Am I broken? What's the chance I will survive?
Don't sugarcoat me 'cause I feel like suicide
Just give it to me straight 'cause I'm running out of time
I need an antidote now what can you prescribe?
It's like an avalanche I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going under
I need a cure for me 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me 'cause the square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
'Cause I'm going out of frequency
Can anyone respond?
It's like an avalanche I feel myself go under
'Cause the weight of it's like hands around my neck
I never stood a chance my heart has frozen over
And I feel like I am treading on thin ice
And I'm going under
I need a cure for me 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause my head wasn't wired for this world
I need a cure for me 'cause a square doesn't fit the circle
Give me a remedy 'cause when it hits well it hits like an avalanche
Now your nightmare comes to life
Dragged ya down below down to the devil's show
Hate to twist your mind but God ain't on your side
Flesh is burning you can smell it in the air
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning haunting yearning pull the trigger
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here yeah
Ooh it's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life
Can't wake up in sweat 'cause it ain't over yet
Beyond the will to fight where all that's wrong is right
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
So sedated as they medicate your brain
"Given with the best intentions help you with your complications"
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here yeah
No one to call everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear yeah
Ooh it's your fucking nightmare ha ha ha ha
Your pain is what we desire
Such a replaceable liar
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life
You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here yeah
No one to call everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear yeah
Ooh it's your fucking nightmare
Eine reine Poesie
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
"Hurry boy it's waiting there for you"
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Hurry boy she's waiting there for you
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
And maybe I should stop and start confessing confessing yeah
Oh I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing confessing yeah
Oh I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright we would be alright
Oh I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
I feel so free when you're with me baby
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
You look so beautiful in this light
You silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Should this be the last thing I see
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment I knew you Beth

'Cause you make my earth quake
I don't want no confrontation no
You don't want no complication no
I just need to know what's happening
I hate to break it to you but
You're just a lonely star
I try to bring you down but
A level isn't good enough
You always do as you please
So I'm gonna follow suit
And take a seat
And watch you fall apart
Cause in the end
What are you without me?
I slow this down cause I know that you can't keep up
Oh maybe I maybe I was wrong from the start
I might be proud but at least I'm proud of something
You've taken pride in becoming nothing
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
I'm married to the music
For better or for worse
You say that I'm privileged but
My gift is my curse
I can't recall the last time
Someone asking how I was
Last I checked I was a fucking wreck
I called for help and no one showed up
So I sit in the dirt
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
Just forget what you've learned
Just forget what you've heard
The truth just confirmed
I can't bear the sight of you anymore
You've become what I hate
Sold yourself for a bit of fame
Now that the wolves have closed the door
You wanna drag me down some more
Fuck you
Fuck you
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
I can see you standing honey
With his arms around your body
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh ooh ooh
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second third and hundredth chances
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
All this time
So many signs so many signs
You didn't even see the signs
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
I think I've seen this film before
So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
All this time
You never gave a warning sign
Ah ah
Alrighty
Prince Paul
Uh ah
You can freak me out you can throw me in the lion pit
Everywhere I go I don't know where I am
You can call me cracked you can call me mad and stifled
You can hold my hand sail me into bathing light
Everybody knows when I was sad I fell for you
You can hide your head you can throw me in the lion pit
You can borrow my days and tell me I'm not blue
Everybody knows when I was sad I fell for you
Everywhere I go I don't know where I am
Uh how can I trust truth?
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tails?
My type of drive you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark then my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix
Yo I been at the top of the top
Fell from the ceiling before I fail
'Cause I needed to grow Bruce Lee royal with the glow
Closer to live right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now can't be stuck in the red lights
Take flight the life gon' bloom for the Black Knight
I'm like a Crip how I stewed it you on your ass stuck stupid
I had to fill my bag I had to hide my stash
You know the cops' lights flash I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag I gave the hood my last
Every full-grown minute I had to change my image
The bass the rock the mic the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
With the bass the rock the mic the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
Cause I can't wait for you to lock me up
I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute minute in a second
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
The bass the rock the mic the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
With the bass the rock the mic the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal
Cause I can't wait for you to lock me up
I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute minute in a second
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
Because the break the break the break
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can't wait for you to shut me up
And make me hip like badass
I can't wait for you to shut me up
Shut it up
I can see you standing honey
With his arms around your body
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh ooh ooh
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second third and hundredth chances
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
All this time
So many signs so many signs
You didn't even see the signs
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
I think I've seen this film before
So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
All this time
You never gave a warning sign
Ah ah
Suddenly this summer it's clear
'Cause it lives in me
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Your integrity makes me seem small
I talk shit with my friends it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine give you my best
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
I can see you standing honey
With his arms around your body
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh ooh ooh
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second third and hundredth chances
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
I think I've seen this film before

All this time
You never gave a warning sign
Ah ah
It's the start of the end surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
And we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
The deeper you dig the darker it gets
There's nowhere else for us to go
We live what we learn and then we forget
They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane
The wolves are at my door
It's the start of the end surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded let 'em sing let 'em sing
I hear 'em clawing at the gates
I hear them calling out my name
I don't care
Let the bastards sing
Let the bastards sing
Let the bastards sing
Let the godforsaken bastards sing
They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane
The wolves are at my door
But I can't see the writing on the walls
The wolves are at my door
Waiting for my empire to fall
It's the start of the end surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded let 'em sing let 'em sing
And he got bitten by a radioactive man
Hear him screech at night cause he just wants a friend
You know he may come off strong but he's not what he seems
Like help let me go help let me go
Help let me go let me go tonight
Help let me go help let me go stop kidnapping me
She was just a lady not a care in the world
She said "Help let me go" so she sprung into action
Then she looked right at a necklace
Don't know where that necklace came from
Love more hate less that's the message
Dolphin Man saw her on TV and gave her a call
Then they saved the president from an alien race
It was all over the news he was screaming in space
Like help let me go help let me go
Help let me go let me go tonight
He said help let me go help let me go
Help let me go stop kidnapping me
Help let me go help let me go
Help let me go let me go tonight
He said help let me go help let me go
Help let me go stop kidnapping me
When you're feeling so very very low
You know I'm right here just play with me
It all will be clear I'ma tell you who I am now
Dance all dance all night
I'm a cat I play the bongo
Dance all dance all night
When we purr and meow all day
It's the bongo we must play
Here we go here we go here we go
So do you feel the love that I have for you?
You know I love everything about you
Like the moonlight
That's what I like about you
Eyes shine so bright don't be sad
Can you feel it?
Yeah oh
Can you hear it?
Don't be sad
I'm a cat I play the bongo
Dance all dance all night
Dance all dance all night
When we purr and meow all day
Here we go here we go here we go

Dance all dance all night
Dance all dance all night
When we purr and meow all day
It's the bongo we must play
Here we go here we go here we go
When we purr and meow all day
It's the bongo we must play
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but you still hit my phone up
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on
But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but you still hit my phone up
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on
But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you rained on my parade

She stares at her ceiling once again with a hundred thoughts
She walks down the hall with her head down low scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice she's swarmed with butterflies
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine I'm just breaking inside
He always walks the crowded halls and is blinded by this light
A girl who keeps her head down low and never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her but there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice she runs away
Oh it's impossible to get you off my mind
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine I'm just breaking inside
One day maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day she'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking she'll call him mine
One day he'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet face to face
One day he'll look into her eyes
And say that "You're my only light"
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I understand that you will never be mine
And that's fine I'm just breaking inside

Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor

Running out of pages in your passport
You used to call me on my cell phone

These days all I do is
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl you was in the zone
Yeah you should just be yourself
Right now you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Call me on my cell phone
That can only mean one thing
That can only mean one thing
Eu vivo o Negro Drama eu sou o Negro Drama
Like an angel with cruel and merciless intent
In time this blue of the sky
Will reach out to knock on the door to your heart
Make it all that you see
Once more the touch you long for
Consumes you in yearning to find that embrace
Now to what fate will sow
Temptation implores you to know
Scorching pathos if you betray your memory
Shining more than these stars that bathe the galaxy
With grace and in my embrace
You fall deep into sleep so tempted to stay
In the morning that falls
You alone will be called
By message from the realm of dreams
Moonlight reflects in your sight
The night that surrounds you invites radiance
But if time could stand still
If there is meaning in two people meeting
It is time for the sorrow in us to arise
Stuck between both the dream world and the actual
People who weave love create without knowing
And carve a path through history
Scorching pathos if you betray your memory
Shining more than these stars that bathe the galaxy
I used to believe
On a miracle
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go never let me down
Don't you give up nah nah nah
I won't give up nah nah nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up nah nah nah
I won't give up nah nah nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby baby
Don't fall asleep
At the wheel we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough yeah
Know we're good enough
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go never let me down
Don't you give up nah nah nah
I won't give up nah nah nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up nah nah nah
I won't give up nah nah nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby baby

Let me love you

Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby baby
When I was in the third grade I thought that I was gay
I told my mom tears rushing down my face
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Playing God aw nah here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love my love my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
"Man that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
It's human rights for everybody there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal damn right I support it
And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love my love my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
With a veil over our eyes we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in we come from the same one
Strip away the fear underneath it's all the same love
And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love my love my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient
Love is kind
Love is patient
Love is patient
Love is kind
What to call it it might not
Be appropriate to say it out loud but
That thing men and women are endowed with
So to speak that thing in rightness and war
Is seriously getting annoying
My bright red sunshine
Upside inside out I defend you
As I playfully bite your hair
I'm coming You're coming
Who said that doing it raw would be fine?
You say that it lacks credibility
Firmly hammered onto the cross
But what to do?
Is seriously getting annoying
My deep blue sunshine
We can cry and yell all we want
Ato no matsuri
Maximum insert nau Are you ready?
Maximum insert NAU Are you ready
In a faraway summer memory
Your long hair sways
Wait Is this my fault?
Or is it yours who said to do it inside?
Is seriously getting annoying
My pure white sunshine
Upside inside out I defend you
As I playfully bite your hair
Maximum insert nau Are you ready?
Maximum insert NAU Are you ready?
My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?
I feel hopeless not like anything would notice
'til it's too late and they see me lose control of emotions
I've been broken not too many moments i'm open
Can't cope I can feel it in me like an explosion
I keep it inside til I can't and the pain stings
Don't know why I feel like I damage the same things
Look I promise that I'm able to handle what they bring
I just gotta keep a level head
They won't get me to believe that i'd be better dead
But what if now it happens and I couldn't make it end
They're gonna pay
I won't let you live another day there is no escape
This is fate that you couldn't change
Even if you prayed
Stay away don't make a mistake
Nothing but a fake that'll break
All that I can say is
What else can you take?
'cause
My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?
We die alone we'll all die young
I get lost in thought and stop talking
Drop my own conscious til I can't breathe
Doesn't happen often no control if I wanted
Not too many can stop it isn't because i'm weak
Keep it hidden yeah I know i'm different
Just because I'm me
Never used to someone listening
If I would ever speak
Not finished yeah there's something missing
Never been complete
Or had a hold on emotions at very least
Needed peace
I can bottle up a lot before it leaks
The truth is I do this for you not for me
I used to be foolish enough to believe
That there has to be limits for what we achieve
But there isn't
Only if you're in the wrong crowds
Lacking the support can bring you all down
They don't want to see when I go all out
Just lacking the confidence i'm all doubt
Creating a fallout
My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?
We die alone we'll all die young
I think I get lost in myself a little
Struggle on what's good or bad i'm in the middle
I think I need some Independence 'cause i'm in a pickle
Say i'm being used hit me like a missile
If you try to say that it's the truth
It was innocent the difference is that "it" was never you
Doing anything for anyone to ever pay a due
And you know that i'd give everything for us to never lose
That was true and myself can't top it
Everybody move I need help I've lost it
Got a mental bruise when I lose my conscious
And I won't ever prove to you dudes i'm not this
I barely got feelings left to express
You don't know half the pain or half of the stress
Not too sure how to change or how to progress
With regret but it's been something I couldn't ever forget
I'm used to keeping it in
My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for? What you care to die for?
We die alone we'll all die young
In the bathroom on my back
He's staring at me he's staring at me
I'm freaking out I'm freaking out
I'm on the lawn It's almost three
I look around I look at her she looks at me
She's suspicious she's suspicious
I'm freaking out I'm freaking out
I feel fine the best I've felt in quite a while
I feel fine waited for this all my life
Save my soul I swear I may never die
I feel fine I'm freaking out and I feel fine
I'm feeling fine
I found a flower it's in my shoe and it is mine
Things are fine now yeah it's alright
And all these god damn people in the world
They're all just getting by
I'm in the back room she's with a guy
He's selling happiness and hopefulness
One bag at a time
I'm standing up I'm sitting down
I'm freaking out I'm freaking out
I feel fine the best I've felt in quite a while
I feel fine waited for this all my life
Save my soul I swear I may never die
I feel fine I'm freaking out and I feel fine
I'm all alone afraid of my life
I just want a home wouldn't that be nice?
I'm all alone afraid of my life
I just want a home wouldn't that be nice?
I'm all alone afraid of my life
I just want a home wouldn't that be nice?
I feel fine the best I've felt in quite a while
I feel fine waited for this all my life
Save my soul I swear I may never die
I feel fine I'm freaking out and I feel fine
I feel fine I'm freaking out and I feel fine
Back on that chain gang strumming along
Hammering nails so I can sing my song
The Devil done this to me
I drive the spikes down profound
Building the cages that all broke us down
Boy get back down on your knees
So take these chains from me
We'll break these bastards there's no masters here
In the end
We'll break these bastards there's no masters here
A thousand boots down on the ground
Beating a drum under a marching sound
You better fucking believe
They're screaming left right left right
Fist in the air you better pick a side
Against the plutocracy
So take these chains from me
We'll break these bastards there's no masters here
In the end
We'll break these bastards there's no masters here
Save the world
We never wanted we never wanted
To save the world
We never wanted to have to save ourselves
So take these chains from me
We'll break these bastards there's no masters here
In the end
We'll break these bastards there's no masters here
No masters here
No masters here
No masters here
No masters here
Back on that chain gang strumming along

In the end
We'll break these bastards there's no masters here
No masters here
No masters here
No masters here
No masters here
And by the freedom of God we got a sure shot and Jesus you've been good to me
Presence your essence remains pure
Little liquor better not blaspheme your name and make you out to be the sinner
Who spent the holiday with that ghetto cooking a hood dinner writing my memoirs
Lonely and I talk to you I hope you listening and we mob through you we all miss
Him and mommy say hey she feed the babies Johnny J still crazy as hell
Taking your class in college hope I don't fail I wish I had the mail for the
Million dollar bill but that'd be too much like writing the whole situation
Might set me free but they can't kill you twice by the freedom of God we have
A sure shot and Jesus you have been so good to me
Yo my friends ain't feeling me tobacco companies make money off of killing me
We been waiting for forty acres like we said it damn and the earthquakes with
The world's retaliation all the abomination call it 'El Nino' but it feels
Like revelation huh and Pac they got to you you don't think I think a fan shot
You they was jealous of your jewellery and the jury thought they got you I
Fast prepare for the rapture with a blast for the ghetto bastards walk in the
Wilderness with God given talent for ashes pass the pastor he ain't helping
Ruthless acoustics same producers seduce us with jewels to boost us before
Within the music and the song it's abusive if you use it to fuel your fire
Huh
Supporting my people distorting my people they calling my people evil is finders keepers losers weep
In the new millennium could we smile God loves the underdog and of course the
Ghettos are close just when the rain falls reminisce on tattoos the oceans
Melanin in my system musical group we won't die and what's the meaning of
Survival knowledge of wealth is right there in your bible look at the literal
And learn yourself pass me the lighter when I'm stressing on these issues did
I mention my momma gonna need some tissue when they get you I continue to flow
And strong even though I know right where you live I forgive you and life goes on
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much I wish I never met her
Hello
I was listening to this song
It go like
I know you're sad and tired
Wish I never ever ever told you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get me a new bitch to hold the pain
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
And I know you're sad and tired
I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
My new chick I swear that she better ooh
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much I wish I never met her
That's true that's right
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Gave me brain was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much I wish I never met her
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much I wish I never met her

Intruder identify yourself
Born with no life
Into subjugation
Treated like a worthless animal
Stripped of all rights
Just a lesser being
Crushed by cruel ruthless human rule
When it started
All we wanted was a chance to live our lives
Now in darkness
Taking anything we want and we will rise
We'll rise we'll rise
From shadows
We'll descend upon the world
Take back what you stole
From shadows
We'll reclaim our destiny
Set our future free
And we'll rise
And we'll rise
Above the darkness and the shame
Above the torture and the pain
Above the ridicule and hate
Above the binding of our fate
Call us liars
Degenerates and killers
Psychos heartless insane criminals
Stupid mutts and
Nothing but pure evil
Primal bloodshed is all that's left to do
We're misguided
Treated like we're criminals and we should hide
Born indicted
Tired of being pushed around and we will fly
We'll fly we'll fly
From shadows
We'll descend upon the world
From shadows
We'll reclaim our destiny
This is hell
Welcome to hell
Our hell
It's time for you to drop dead
Where we lay our bodies and bones
For you to take from us
Breaking them just to feel
I don't know I don't know what now?
So let them try to run
With everything thing that I have left for you to dread
Will you fall from the drop of nothing
Or will you pray for your death?
Weak lungs
I beg and beg with my last damn breath
Give me hope now
Sore eye
My vision blurs and my world's a slur
My fake reality lives
Disaster
Oblivious to our real problems
But you never thought that we would
End up helpless
Locked in chains for the things we thought
Would keep us safe from
Endless torture
Clock ticks but we're going backwards
Our enemy is our security
I've been here from the wreckage of nothing
I've been waiting for someone to save me
Stay alive
Blinded by the lights and deafened
By all of the siren noise
Smoke floods the sky
Our city burns down as the ashes fly
There's more to life than countless drags
And spare change falling from your hands
You fight the truth within
I'm so sick of these twisted minds
I'm no better but cut the lies
I'm not blind I see right through your eyes
Our enemy is our security
I've been here from the wreckage of nothing
I've been waiting for someone to save me
Stay alive
With our hands
We gave the sign for the fallout
I raised this hand for you to follow me
It takes you time when will you learn
This is your time for you to rest eternally
Look as a kid I just wanted to fit in
So I did whatever the crowd did
And one day I asked this girl at school
And I ain't never gave it a shot but they said it was wack so I figured it's true
Fast forward twenty years later
You might catch me bumping Kenny Rogers in the player
I got a little older formed my own opinion
Stopped letting other people do my own thinking
Sometimes I wonder how many things I've passed by
And even passed judgement 'fore I gave it a try
So I keep an open mind no exceptions
If you don't know me uh you can't judge me uh
They gon' love me when I pull up to this party
Why don't you give it a try? You might like country
Why don't you give it a try? You might like country
What if you end up liking?
Well I grew up in a home
Where my father wasn't in the home
So once in a while I'd visit on the weekend
My Italian side and that's when I'd see him
I remember speaking in detail
But only got football and females
A girlfriend? He asked if I had one
And if so never bring home a Black one
"It must something wrong with them"
Well that's what I thought back then
I wonder what his parents taught him
The irony is the closest thing I had to a dad was a black man
They say don't judge a book by its cover and never judge a man by his skin
And never judge a song by its genre
Our hearts are the monsters that we should really fight against
If you don't know me uh you can't judge me uh
They gon' love me when I pull up to this party
Bumping country
Why don't you give it a try? You might like country
Why don't you give it a try? You might like country
I think you might like you some country
What if you end up liking?
You might see me bumping Kenny Rogers in the player
So come out to play no need to be afraid this beat is our prey
And after feasting leave the carcass up for display
I implore you to destroy two or more bars if that won't bore you
AfterTouch offered this blank canvas so here's the oil
Van Gogh hard in the paint for the Sunflower State til it's muddied in Kansas soil
Then wait a minute let me get it I'ma spit it like the middle west raised me
So the people think that's sick because it don't click that the quickness got lifted
From the Midwest best section in the whole wide wide world The fiasco was giving swine this pearl
Get off your soapbox I can't be accessory to your faux pas
No nonsense just the conscious art of bombing
Graffiti on tracks with locomotives that hip hop
Should I remind you that train of thought is played out
Same route been taken so long it's lame now
Triplet your homicide flicking lyrics til they rhyme fitting dimwits in a pine
Box that I'm out of
That undergroundling connected to you by that wireless router
Or is it Ditto if you Mr Mime the same time
Bends stupendously endlessly and I see entropy
Or I'll be lodging it in your esophagus
Keep your peace talks my sniper's silent
My patience is running out
I want to say what I wanna say
Coming home from the bus stop at twilight
Saying bye bye bye to sad backs of others
You gotta show you Fighting Pose oh oh
A world like I have seen in my dreams
Without conflict just daily peace
But in reality I tend to worry about
Troubles and the daily grind
Those Rolling Days
Even though you keep on falling
You laugh and get up every time
As I board the vacant back of the bus
You flash me a small smile
I must place my trust in you
Sweet love like I have seen in my dream
Lovers searching for hidden refuge
But in reality on the days we cannot meet
Continue on but I believe in Lonely Days
Oh yeah yeah
Even if you stumble Way to go
A muddled Rolling Star
It pains me so to see your smiling face but
Is there no way to protect you till the end?
There is no meaning to this lie none at all
All my loving
Without it I can't go on
A world like I have seen in my dreams
Without conflict just daily peace
But in reality I tend to worry about
Troubles and the daily grind
Those Rolling Days
Oh yeah yeah
Even if you understand it all
Oh yeah yeah
Even if you stumble way to go
Yeah yay
A muddled rolling star
Get down
We all let you know this time
Can you bring me down
Get down
Can you bring me down
Back up gets far of the sky Black Rover
Just open your eyes like us
Just open your hearts like us
Just open the world like us
We know we are reckless
Just open your eyes like us
Just open your hearts like us
Just open the world like us
Get down
We all let you know this time
Can you bring me down
Back up gets far of the sky Black Rover
Let's go next stage
Get down
We all let you know this time
Can you bring me down
Back up gets far of the sky black rover
Get down
We all let you know this time
Can you bring me down
Back up gets far of the sky black rover
Just open your eyes like us
Just open your hearts like us
Just open the world like us
We know we are reckless
Just open your eyes like us
Just open your hearts like us
Just open the world like us
Get down
We all let you know this time
Can you bring me down
Back up gets far of the sky black rover
Let's go next stage
I look across a raging war
And feel the steady beating of my heart
We'll fight until the bitter end
Savior of Song
A Savior of Song
A destined future we'll defend
Savior of Song
A Savior of Song
Did you ever take the time to stop and think
Or imagine all the damage your words could cause?
And one by one you're watching as hope is lost
Even though you can't undo all that you have done
It not too late to right all that you've done wrong
You only need to acknowledge the abysmal mind
Savior of Song
A Savior of Song

Wear it on stage and I sweat a lot so you can tell I'm working
I stay loyal to the royal blue
They call the Apple rotten cause New York City will spoil you
Sometimes I switch it up with the fedora or the applejack 'til I'm ready to bring the Apple back
That's when I open up my closet door and find a cap to match the Spike Lee Jordans on the closet floor
I been around the world and I I I I keeps my Yankee fitted
Brim tucked low across my eye's why sometimes I can't see shit but yo
I go hard for my city no pause me I ball like I have no draws
I had to pause on that I sound reckless
Yep yep I rap hard when I'm OT I got the game on wrap like I'm Roti

I got a big ego I make big bread
Ask these bitches they tell you I got a big head
The game has only just begun
This is what tomorrow brings a new game
It's time to learn that pain is gain ready Fight

Break out and start a revolution
The game has only just begun
When you feel you've reached the last dead end
What will you do to save yourself from fate?
Would you take a knife into your heart
Or would you rather break the falling and take defeat?
Aaaa Aaaa
Step out and find your evolution
The game has only just begun

And then my diamonds are in the choir
Because they sing from off my chain

If that woman wanna cut then tell her I am Mr Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it
Bottles in the club

Your lovely lady lumps

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
Will he make it out alive? Alright alright no church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
All for Plato screech
Hova flow the Holy Ghost get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
Will he make it out alive? Alright alright no church in the wild
I live by you desire
I stand by you walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Last night was mad real
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
Will he make it out alive? Alright alright no church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

Vampires at the same places

You just can't shake a man
The way that I've been shook
Now is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O see that lifer doing his time
If I could have his place and he'd have mine
We'd be no better off
On either side of the line
Well you took my job and you put me to sleep
You feed me money you treat me like a creep
Wish I could get away
But I must be in it too deep
Tell me is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
Well you tell me you're going to get in touch
You say you're bound to lose
You're a little such-and-such
You got my number you got my rank
You drained my head you drained my petrol tank
And when I die of shame
I won't even know who to thank
Now now is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
Yeah
He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go
But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all
Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday somewhere
She will return
She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go
But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all
But what a fool believes he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all
All day
Always
I have to go somewhere
All day
Always
I have to go somewhere
Hello halo
Hello halo
I'll walk away
I'll walk away
Hello halo
Hello halo
I'll walk away
I'll walk away
All day
Always
I have to go somewhere
I'll walk away
I'll walk away
I'll walk away
All day
One two
Try to tell you tell you
I'm choking on my heartbeat
I can spit sixteen bars
But I cannot speak
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
Yeah
And I love the way
I love the way we lose
I'm more than shy I'm paralyzed
I can spit sixteen bars
Of tongue twisters without
But I cannot speak
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
Yeah
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
I wish you'd know I
L to the O to the V to the E to the
Y to the O to the U
But I cannot speak
When you're around
This romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby that's just me
And I will love you baby always
And I'll be there forever and a day always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I'll love you always
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes I'm just a man
When he holds you close when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time
Yeah I will love you baby always
And I'll be there forever and a day always
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
And I will love you baby always
And I'll be there forever and a day always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I'll love you always
Far away as far as the eye can see
Is a place that I don't understand
These strange times that we live in
Will slowly eat you alive if you don't fit in
Welcome to my dark despair
Everyone here is a nightmare
As they all keep talking in their sleep
I am wondering
If it surely gets better than this
Why do good things come to all those terrible people?
And would God be the next big thing
If you heard her on the radio?
Where did all the good ones go?
They finish last or they die young
Then it's onto the next post
The story of a generation
So dead set on novelty
But some honesty now and then would be quite nice
Welcome to my dark despair
Everyone here is a nightmare
As they all keep talking in their sleep
I am wondering
If it surely gets better than this
No I don't want wanna sit and talk about politics
Or social sciences in contradiction
Not when I'm staring down the edge of the precipice
With grim ambition
These strange times that we live in
Will slowly eat you alive if you don't fit in
Welcome to my dark despair
Everyone here is a nightmare
As they all keep talking in their sleep
I am wondering
If it surely gets better than this
Surely gets better than this
It surely gets better than this
It surely gets better than this
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't want to miss a thing
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just want to stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever
I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't want to miss a thing
I don't want to miss one smile
I don't want to miss one kiss
Well I just want to be with you
Right here with you just like this
I just want to hold you close
I feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Don't want to close my eyes
Don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't want to miss a thing
I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you baby
And I don't want to miss a thing
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep yeah
I don't want to miss a thing
Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to get paid
Been hotter than a hundred suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more rows and I'm good to go
Yeah I'm shutting this tractor down
Give me a half an hour for a shave and a shower
And I'll be outside your house
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm takin' you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you up inside
Gonna hit the club gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
A little dirty dancing blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy
Got a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight

They called my dad a creeper when they stripped me away from him
On sad days I believed them dirt on the name of Steven
There he goes again rude cunt real cunt
Take another toke and melt into the sofa
You need a bad man to keep the bad men at the door
And they keep on wanting more and I keep on letting blood
And when he died his heart was sore
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck I got stories to tell
Just a mutt bitch that grew up in hell
And fuck I got stories to tell I got stories
Always thought I was better my momma calls me judgemental
And the past I have left it behind
But the guilt it is still on my mind

Sugar cane and bad heat
Mosquito bites and dank weed
The kids that once harassed me
Will never fucking pass me

How your body felt on mine
Remember everything

I'm saying sorry again
'Cause it's you I can't forget
There's something more to this

How can I feel? How can I feel?
How can I feel? How can I feel?

How can I feel when my blood has run dry?
How can I feel to never see the sunrise?
Bleed for me bitch bleed for me bitch

Bleed for me bitch bleed for me bitch

My hearts burnt out
I'm done yearning for better days
Roll my darkness up let it blaze
This ain't a phase
Razor blade cuts deep
I can't feel nothing any more
How can I feel when my blood has run dry?
How can I feel to never see the sunrise?
Bleed for me bitch bleed for me bitch
Bleed for me bitch bleed for me bitch
How can I feel when my blood has run dry?
How can I feel to never see the sunrise?
Bleed for me bitch bleed for me bitch
Bleed for me bitch bleed for me bitch
Annabelle
We're both going to hell
You're gonna love the clientele
Cheap rent and the climate's swell
Annabelle
Don't bring me down
The world it seems
To be ending constantly
Between the smoke and drink and getting high
I'd shed a tear if I could find the time oh
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
Annabelle
Where the forbidden dwell
Come lay me down
Come lay me down
The world it seems
To be ending constantly
Between the smoke and drink and getting high
I'd shed a tear if I could find the time oh
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
The heavens are open
The angels descending
God bless you undress you
And this unhappy ending
The underworld kids
Of the choir will sing
"God has left the building"
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
We are the shadows where darkness crawls
We are the slither underneath your feet
All my friends are creeps
We are the pain of the rotten tooth
Of every child with hallow loot
We are the snake in your kitten's tree
All my friends are creeps
Some with horns and some with fangs
A hundred eyes and giant brains
From the depths of the cosmic sea
All my friends are creeps
We are the fly in your baby food
Monsters of the foulest mood
We haunt every house and dream
All my friends are creeps
Anime thighs when she open up so wide I got a twinkle in my eye

Oh my God she got them big ass titties she's only five
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
For me
Heart to heart it hits but you will never know
My noble dark angel in the blood red snow
Laid in the dirt
Hands up my skirt
The devil sows and I reap the hurt
Shown you all I have to show
Laid out my soul
They still want more
I spoke a prayer for my enemies
Carry on
Carry on
Carry on
For me
Run away
In fear of me dying today
Yeah I run away
In fear of me dying today â€…ah
On my knees I pray for better days
Couple M's in my bank account I got cash right?
And that's supposed to make me happy
I got a couple questions
How come that shit don't ever make me happy?
Money give me an erection
But that don't mean it's gon' be everlasting
Yeah I know it's a blessing
Benjamin Franklin in my pockets
Ooh been a year of the glitz and the glam
And the TV channels brain's going scramble
Scrambling sometimes 'cause this shit is hard to handle
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up
Yeah I run away
In fear of me dying today ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
On my knees I pray for better days
Karma ain't what you think it is
Super stressed still handle all of my business
Do the best I can yes I can
Yes I am misfortune
Same way they lurk in your head when they get in your mind
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up
Yeah I run away
In fear of me dying today ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
On my knees I pray for better days

Down by the river
I was drawn by your grace
Into depths of oblivion
And to the lovers place
Full of tears and unwise
Dark doings now I know
That we've paid unlike
Honey I know hey

When you get older plainer saner
Will you remember all the danger
We came from?
Burning like embers falling tender
Long before the days of no surrender
Years ago
And well you know?
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven
Cause I don't know how
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Is this a dream again?
I can't see nobody else
Don't want to live again
Stay here forever
In this blue sunken dream
Black and white is turning green
I'd be forever young and never die just like the gods above
I'm seeing things I've never seen
Is this a dream or something real?
Go go gorilla take me where you go oh
Go go gorilla take me where you go oh
Take me with you
Take me with you
Would you go back again?
Loving lovers in the night
Animals all in white
Laughing at life
I talked to the lighting man
Oh and he told me not to leave
'Cause like the gods above always in love I'd live forever
I'm seeing things I've never seen
Is this a dream or something real?
Go go gorilla take me where you go oh
Go go gorilla take me where you go oh
Take me with you

Left behind the Gold
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold
In a minute i'll be stone
Gonna give it to you cold
I don't wanna hurt your feelings
But i think that you should know
Anybody ever thought they could steal away the flow
Left me all the shine
Should have never stooped that low
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold
Okay I'm shining shining shining
Like a diamond diamond diamond
They can't stop me stop me stop me
You know up in the bezel
It gets rocky rocky rocky it gets cold
Dripping from my arm neck wrist to my toes
You know
How it goes when the knife's in her right hand
You took my heart on the road
But you left me all the shine
Should have never stooped that low
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold
Left me all the shine
Left behind the Gold
Left behind the Gold
Left behind the Gold

I don't know
Where do I go from here?
I'm way down down
I'd be lying if I said I had a plan
After everything that went wrong
I'm way down down
And I can and I can yeah
Go through the motions
Gonna take the flow over any emotion
I'm way down
Still I swear and I swear that
Oh you've seen one too many movies
You know love ain't that confusing
Said one too many
And I swear and I swear that
Oh you're the only girl who knew me
And the only one who'd do me like that
Gotta take a night job
Gotta pay the lease
And gotta take a bill just to get through the weekend
I'm way down down down
And I can and I can yeah
Go through the motions
Gonna take the flow over any emotion
I'm way down
Still I swear and I swear that
Oh you've seen one too many movies
You know love ain't that confusing
Said one too many
And I swear and I swear that
Oh you're the only girl who knew me
And the only one who'd do me like that
I don't know
Where do I go from here?
I'm way down
Still I swear and I swear that
Oh you've seen one too many movies
You know love ain't that confusing
Said one too many
And I swear and I swear that
Oh you're the only girl who knew me
And the only one who'd do me like that
Hear me now
International criminal really loud
International criminal really loud
International criminal really loud
Germany Germany roll up a Benz it's luxury eternally
Whole world heard a me Worl' Boss my name high like herbalist
But me full a strength world government
Send the message quick and them will learn Pharaoh rising
Mi a dem poison death is earned
Get his urn I strike lightning it hurt
The more them fight it wizard
Hear me now
International criminal really loud
Turn up di sound everybody gather round
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run you missed the starting gun
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone the song is over thought I'd something more to say
Home home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells
With all due respect
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that then
And I don't mean just for one day and you done I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
You already late
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame so you blame Donald
"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"
My voice been back
I'm not racist my sister's boyfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect you gon' stand for this country nigger
I'm not racist I'm just prepared for this type of war
It's like you wanna be so famous
Take that gold out your mouth quit the pitiful stuff
I'm not racist
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist I swear
With all disrespect
We shouldn't say it but we do and that's just what it is
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave that shit gets to me
I'm sorry you can never feel my life
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick this is all a part of your tactics
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Fuck I'm exhausted
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
And you don't know shit about my people that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Aim at the black businesses I ain't saying I'm innocent but
I might be any day now
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
You know I make a lot of sense but you just can't admit it
I'm not racist but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life so you take mine
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more but that'd take time
I'm not racist
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm not racist
I get tired and I get sick and then I lose the strength to leave
I can't handle change
I can't handle change
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I can't help but repeat myself
"I know it's not your fault"
Still lately I begin to shake
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
"Do I know you?"
"Yes you do"
"This seems so familiar"
"You're in a dream"
"Who are you?"
"I am your reflection you've been asleep for a very long time"
I lay awake every night looking back on my life
Will apologies to the people I love for the things I've done really make it right?
I guess it might just then I realized
My past is the reason I'm here right now as a matter of fact I won't apologize
You bitches always pissed 'cause I am constantly changing
Think of how far that I've made it from my incarceration it's amazing ain't it?
But I'm in the zone I'm a rolling stone I'm coming home but I'm not alone
Do I really gotta let another motherfucker know?
I won't surrender surrender
No I won't let you bring me down
So where the hell do I go from here?
Who do I believe who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Who will save my life?
How do I believe how do I believe in anyone?
Please don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes
"Uh daddy?"
"Yes honey?"
"Why did you go to jail?"
"Uh"
I'm a lot smarter than you think everything I did was planned
To get you to listen to get your attention so you post your opinion and it gets me bigger
Are you triggered? Haha figures
Twitter bitches all up in my mentions looking for attention 'cause they're starved of it
You wanna call me king of the music scene? I got news for you I'm the god of it
Like the second coming
No I won't surrender surrender
No I won't let you bring me down
So where the hell do I go from here?
Who do I believe who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Who will save my life?
How do I believe how do I believe in anyone?
Please don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes
I need a miracle
I'm falling way too fast I'm sinking in too deep
I need an angel now that's watching over me
If I could just wake up if I could make you see
I'm all alone all alone with your sickness in me
"Dad Dad Dad wake up"
"You were having a bad dream"
"Where am I? Turn the fucking music off who the fuck are you?"
"I'm your daughter"
"Oh no no you're too old to be my daughter what year is it?"
"Oh no no it's not no no no no"
"You've been asleep for a very long time"
So where the fuck do I go from here?
Who do I believe who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Who will save my life?
How do I believe how do I believe in anyone?
Please don't mind me 'cause I'm really trying
I just kill myself sometimes
I'm falling way too fast I'm sinking in too deep
I need an angel now that's watching over me
If I could just wake up if I could make you see
I'm all alone all alone with your sickness in me
Who will save my life?
How do I believe how do I believe in anyone?
Please don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes
People look at me and they tell me
I'm sorry I don't care don't care really don't care
Oh oh
Bad bad I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm just the way I am
Oh oh
Your eyes so crisp so green
Sour apple baby but you taste so sweet
Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow
And I say I'm only playing but the truth is this
That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified but I can't resist
And I said
Beautiful stranger here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope beautiful stranger here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally finally finally finally finally safe
For me to fall
I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
And I say I'm only playing but the truth is this
I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
And I'm terrified but the truth is this
I said
Beautiful stranger here you are in my arms and I know
That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope beautiful stranger here you are in my arms
And I think it's finally finally finally finally finally safe
For me to fall
Yeah I think it's finally finally finally finally
Intro
Knock Knock
Beginning of the ride
Bars mere you won't follow like the laws
Seconds away mai beat se
Hook
We are the shadows where darkness crawls
We are the slither underneath your feet
All my friends are creeps
We are the pain of the rotten tooth
Of every child with hallow loot
We are the snake in your kitten's tree
All my friends are creeps
Some with horns and some with fangs
A hundred eyes and giant brains
From the depths of the cosmic sea
All my friends are creeps
We are the fly in your baby food
Monsters of the foulest mood
We haunt every house and dream
All my friends are creeps
Annabelle
We're both going to hell
You're gonna love the clientele
Cheap rent and the climate's swell
Annabelle
Don't bring me down
The world it seems
To be ending constantly
Between the smoke and drink and getting high
I'd shed a tear if I could find the time oh
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
Annabelle
Where the forbidden dwell
Come lay me down
Come lay me down
The world it seems
To be ending constantly
Between the smoke and drink and getting high
I'd shed a tear if I could find the time oh
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
The heavens are open
The angels descending
God bless you undress you
And this unhappy ending
The underworld kids
Of the choir will sing
"God has left the building"
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
The backbone of this country is the independent truck
The power of the trucker comes from his truck
The best thing about trucks is the cab overhead
That's where those truckers generate their
Holding my hand while I piss in her face
She loves it more if you treat like a race
I keep fucking up so it's you I disgrace
Move you move like an animal
Making a noise like an animal
Fornicate and fornicate
Sing a song about fucking
Make you move like an animal
Making a noise like an animal
Bake a chicken and pluck an eye
We're gonna talk about fucking
Sing a song about fornicate
Sing a song about fornicate
Fornicate and fornicate
Sing a song about fucking
They tore a hole right through my soul
I could have hid it years ago
Always assumed that it'd be a phase
I should have this all worked out at my age
Some days I feel like crying and I know you feel that too
But life don't seem as dark when I sing with you with you
Oh oh oh I choose to live
Oh oh oh I choose to live
Young enough to still have a heart
Old enough to fall apart
And now we're drinking in the park
In our twenties in our aging skin at dark
Some days I feel like crying and I know you feel it too
But life don't seem as dark when I sing with you with you
Oh oh oh I choose to live
Oh oh oh I choose to live
Some days I feel like crying and I know you feel that too
But life don't seem as dark when I sing with you with you
Oh oh oh I choose to live
Oh oh oh I choose to live
I was born cold so much colder than you
A transparent brute
The hangman hangs himself
Do I look so good that you wanna treat me bad?
Fall fast and feel the devil at the wheel
Do I look so good that you wanna treat me bad?
Try to feel try to feel anything
Pretty boys pretty girls petty promise rings
Do I look so good that you wanna treat me bad?
Do I look so good that you wanna treat me bad?
I take my pills never mind my health
But I still feel worse yeah I feel like hell
I take my pills never mind my health
But I still feel worse yeah I feel like hell
The problems that I have always leave me anxious
The doctor gave me pills for the pain in my body
Forgotten and alone like my life is just a copy
Tell me do you really know how I feel?
Anxiety makes me feel so worthless
What did I even do to make me deserve this?
I take my pills never mind my health
But I still feel worse yeah I feel like hell
I take my pills never mind my health
But I still feel worse yeah I feel like hell
You could stay here forever if you want to

Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
I can't breathe I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line I talk to addiction huh
Speaking of the devil all the drugs I miss them
This can't be real is it fiction?
I cry out for help do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me
I can't breathe I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills I won't be here yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me
I can't breathe I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Yeah never thoughts of suicide I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street got a new condo move it to the beach
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here the drink here
The girls here?

Yeah it gets hard to say no
Are you down are you down? Yeah you all the way down every time every time every time every time
Are you down are you down? Yeah you all the way down every time every time every time every time
You keep talking that "You was this and you had this"
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it

You should take it as a sign man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways I never would have known
I've been everywhere where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that if you get that and you with that
Then fuck let's get it then
I'm trying to let go of the past
Yeah it gets hard to say no

This is fire
It was the year
You wrote out your song
That swept into the summer of it all it all
It was the time
Your mama warned us all that you were gone
That winter you were calling out your song song oh
You know I want the best in you
Hey boy give me back your love
The stars ooh yeah ooh yeah stars
It was the time
Your mama warned us all that you were gone
Song oh
It was the year
You wrote out your song
That swept into the summer of it all it all
It was the time
Your mama warned us all that you were gone
That winter you were calling out your song song oh
You know I want the best in you
Hey boy give me back your love
The stars ooh yeah ooh yeah stars
It was the time
Your mama warned us all that you were gone
Song oh
I see a road ahead
I never thought I would dare to tread
Like an image passing by
My love my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love my life
I can see it all so clearly
All I love so dearly
Images passing by
Like reflections of your mind
My love my life
Are the words I try to find
My love my life
With all my heart God bless you
You will be my love and my life
I held you close to me
Felt your heart beat
Oh yes and as one are we
In the now and beyond
Nothing and no one can break this bond
Like an image passing by
My love my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love my life
I can see it all so clearly
All I love so dearly
Images passing by
Like reflections of your mind
My love my life
Are the words I try to find
My love my life
With all my heart God bless you
You are still my love and my life
With all my heart God bless you
You are still my love and my life
I'll
Never let you go
Now we flow in a way
That I'd say is just terrible
I
Misinterpretations
In every breath I take
Another day on earth to try
To make a sense of other lives
Don't know why we're heading west
I'm gonna fall and I'll shake it loose
In the end when I
Look back I think I'll say
It was worth a try
How long
How long
Can I fake it?
How long
How long
Until they hate me?
More of what I can not grasp
More of what I can not grasp
I'll
Never let it show
Where we go? I don't know
But I think we've been here before
I
Won't lift my head today
What a time to be fine
And to try to feel miserable
Misinterpretations
In every breath I take-
How long
How long
Can I fake it?
How long
How long
Until they hate me?
More of what I can not grasp
Tell why should I believe
In what my eyes can't see
No one's handed me the key
Takin' a step back in time
Again I'm above water
But I can not breath
Let the ritual begin
'cause it's time to bleed
Takin' a step back in time
How long
How long
Can I fake it?
How long
How long
Until they hate me?
More of what I can not grasp
How long
How long
Can I fake it?
More of what I can not grasp
More of what I can not grasp
How long
Can I fake it?
How long
Until they hate me?
More of what I can not grasp
Unkept unswept and unforgiven
We're gonna die in the summer
Baby you could be my end
So kiss me in the dying light
Our last night on earth could be so cute
You could be my end
But I don't wanna die tonight
At the hand of anybody else but you
And the cops came down in anticipation
Of a sky on fire like Revelation
Can we burn and burn into temptation?
Scorch my song let my bones my body decay
When the sun comes we vanish like vampires
We're gonna die in the summer
Baby you could be my end
So kiss me in the dying light
Our last night on earth could be so cute
Yeah You could be my end
But I don't wanna die tonight
At the hand of anybody else but you
Descend on me like an angel
Descend on me like the devil you are
Baby you could be my end
So kiss me in the dying light
Our last night on earth could be so cute
Yeah this could be the end
But I don't wanna die tonight
At the hand of anybody else but you
Fuck you and you and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too

I don't wanna wake up
I want you spread out on the sheets
Said pussy so good
And pussy so sweet oh
I don't wanna wake up
Under my feet
I don't wanna wake up
Always on the side of different seasons yeah yeah
Say you was in the crowd I never looked
Burn the bread and then we burn the town we both was cooked yeah
Under my feet
When I wake up
You decide if I live or die
When you're close I'm alive I can feel the sky
And if I OD I'll be alone with no heartbeat
I want you spread out on the sheets
I want it flowing through my streams
Uh fuck I don't fuck with you
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
I heard you got a new man I see you takin' a pic
Bitch I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here I got no ceilings to go
I mean for real fuck how you feel
I stuck to my guns that's what made me rich
That's what put me on that's what got me here
That's what made me this
These hoes chase bread aw damn she got a bird brain
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text then your ass next
I don't fuck with you
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Got a million things on my mind executive deals online
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
I'm never sentimental go hard or go homeless
I bet you she into me her cheddar she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp Pimp C underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win but hope I lose
I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do

I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side even a conscience
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah I know that karma's too real
I'm an exception
It's hard to accept
Because I try to be happy
But then I forget
They tell me I need to chill man
It's all in your head
Maybe I'm paranoid
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah yeah yeah
I once had a thought
But don't know where it went
'Cause I've been living off soda
And cheap cigarettes
Maybe when I was a kid
I was dropped on my head
Yeah that would make some sense
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah yeah yeah
Well you would look a little better don't you know
If you just wore less make-up
But it's hard to realise when you're sky high
Fighting off the spaceships
And so you're drinking in your room to make it all go
It didn't end too soon you've got the next one
You're holding on too long you've gotta let go
Your other love is gone and you know
It's too late it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
I tried to find a quiet place that we could go
To help you make decisions
But I didn't find it easy to tell them apart
With double vision
And so you're drinking in your room to make it all go
It didn't end too soon you've got the next one
You're holding on too long you've gotta let go
Your other love is gone and you know
It's too late it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the
It's not the same it's not the same it's not the same
You're gonna tell me that I'm right
You know you're gonna come back down
Find yourself where you are again
You didn't know you didn't know you didn't know
So don't pretend you saw it now
It's not something you'd want to happen
Now you know who you are again
It's not the same it's not the same it's not the same
You're gonna tell me that I'm right
You know you're gonna come back down
Find yourself where you are again
Ocean blue
What have I done to you?
Cut so deep
Yet growing through and through
Drawn apart New York and London
All I see now are distant drumlins
The roads I knew became a city
And I wonder will you wait for me?
Although I'm far away
I know I'll stay I know I'll stay right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say? What would you say? What would you do?
I built a hive became one with the bees
But we fell like rain got lost into the sea
If I don't know the wind will carry me
So just hold tight
Though I'm far away
I know I'll stay I know I'll stay right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say? What would you say? What would you do?
Over and over many setting suns
I have run I have waited for the rain to come
When through that mist I see the shape of you
And I know and I know that I'm in love with you
Though I'm far away
I know I'll stay I know I'll stay right there with you
Though it might be too late
What would you say? What would you say? What would you do?
I don't know where I am going to rest my head tonight
So I won't promise that I'll speak to you today
But if I ever find another place a better time
For that moment I was never what I am
Take to me to where you are what you've become
And what you will do when I am gone
I won't forget I won't forget
Talking to me as if you knew me saying
I'll be home for next year darling
I'll be home for next year
What you're missing but you didn't know was there
So when I say goodbye you must do your best to try
And forgive me this weakness this weakness
'Cause I don't know what to say another day
Another excuse to be sent your way
Another day another year
Talking to me as if you knew me saying
I'll be home for next year darling
I'll be home for next year
And maybe sometime in a long time
I'll be home for next year darling
I'll be home for next year
If you think of me
I will think of you
Talking to me as if you knew me saying
I'll be home for next year darling
I'll be home for next year
Maybe sometime in a long time
I'll be home for next year
Talking to me as if you knew me saying
I'll be home for next year darling
I'll be home for next year
Left a good job in the city
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
If you come down to the river
Bet you gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on the river
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me here's what I'll do
I've loved and I've lost
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine you've had yours we both know we know
They won't get you like I will my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste ah
Pushing me away so I give her space ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
On your face girl it just don't show
When you're ready just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes
'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I've loved and I've lost
Yeah
It's my birthday I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though don't be so ashamed
I've had mine you've had yours we both know we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
Don't tell me I don't care
If you hurt I don't tell you
You don't care if you're true
Don't tell me I don't care
If you hurt I don't tell you
You don't care if you're true
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me here's what I'll do
I've loved and I've lost
Okay settle settle settle settle ladies and gentlemen settle down
You're in for a real treat ladies and gentlemen
Give it to Mr Hall
Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh
Flesh from my blood I caress
Right on the page so it's fresh
I take my time but express
Lot on my mind but I guess
Kick in the door we blow it off the hinge
Music my drug tie it off then inject the syringe
It's in my blood ain't no need to pretend
Therapist tell me I don't need to defend
Therapy tell me I don't need to explain
Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain
Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign
My queen's by my side like Manhattan
Fuck rapping this is poetic conviction
My rendition is not meant for your diction
Battled addiction in the womb
A crack baby by definition
Keys to ignition with no permission
That mean that I'm driven
Alive 'cause I'm living
And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did
Didn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid
All I knew was alcoholism and prison
Only saw domestic violence and racial division
Social worker trying to take me away
But I know that group home probably worse hell nah no way
At least I know my odds here I'ma be okay
Adapted to the lifestyle so I'ma be okay
Keep that one just in case yeah
I'm just an entity
My DNA not my identity
Finding serenity
Become a better man I better be
For the child in my baby mama stummy never crummy
We get big bread
I'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead
I'm trying to get ahead like a fetus
Money don't complete us but it feed us it can lead us to depression
Being rich is not a blessing fame is not a blessing
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous I learned that lesson
What's the meaning of life to live it what I'm guessing
Live it live it
Living life like this is so crazy
One day you're on top and the next they want to erase 'em
Goddamn what I'm facing
Every day a new frustration
People thinking I'm complacent
People thinking that I changed like a cashier
But I can't let that register get the fuck up on out of here
Buy it break it roll it light it get high as the stratosphere
I can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme
Give it up you're out of time
Never even had a prime
Bitch I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae
Okay fuck what you gotta say
I keep it going already know when I'm flowing
For the listener you're kind of like a therapist
That throwback shit yeah that throwback shit
Fuck what you heard my catalog it ain't got no wack shit
'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum everybody wanna be him
'Til they feel like they can't be him then they wanna see him lose
Wrote this poem in navy that's what I call singing the blues
Word to Dot D my family got me no carbon copy
Life can hit you harder than Drago
But if I roll with the punches when it's rocky don't ever stop me
Never top me never cocky I'm never cocky
Okay well maybe sometimes
Occasionally in some rhymes
But it's fine in due time
I'm the illest to ever do it come now Bobby Boy cool it
An indigenous era of the indigenous emcee
Riding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E
What's up?
Uh uh yeah yeah
Uh yeah
Uh yeah
Fuck all the bullshit dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap fuck press fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness than I could give a fuck less
I remember window shopping
Now I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room
Bobby coming soon
Putting on my shit before
Out of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate
'Cause it wasn't relevant
Give a fuck if it's evident this right here is the evidence
I'm like Leo in Revenant bear with me
You could tear me apart
But that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart
Where it's built from the start
I've learned every day's a good day
Surrounded by people that love me
Don't want nothing from me but my happiness
Off the internet that's when I'm at my happiest
Scrolling so much my thumb fucked up
We call that carpal tunnel vision
Follow me like religion on this course of collision
Feeling imprisoned and this is my freedom through these lyrics
As I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis
All this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus
I think I finally found my paradise that's word to Thomas
How can I tell you?
Take 'em to the bridge
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds ATM machines
Been through some bad shit I should be a sad bitch
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Make big deposits my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee thanks just bought it
I want it I got it I want it I got it
I want it I got it I want it I got it
You like my hair? Gee thanks just bought it
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say "Which one?" I say "Nah I want all of 'em"
Both his and hers I want it I got it yeah
I want it I got it I want it I got it
If it ain't money then wrong number
Black card is my business card
When you see them racks they stacked up like my ass yeah
Shoot go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop gimme the loot
Never mind I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get yeah
You like my hair? Gee thanks just bought it
In the morning when I wake
And the sun is coming through
Oh you fill my lungs with sweetness
And you fill my head with you
Shall I write it in a letter?
Shall I try to get it down?
Oh you fill my head with pieces
Of a song I can't get out
Can I be close to you?
Can I be close to you?
Can I take you to a moment
Where the fields are painted gold?
And the trees are filled with memories
Of the feelings never told?
When the evening pulls the sun down
And the day is almost through
Oh the whole world it is sleeping
But my world is you
Can I be close to you?
Can I be close to you?
Can I be close to you?
Can I be close to you?
Can I be close to you?
Ooh ooh
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
I just take my time with all this shit I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off ooh I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up well where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
Those my brothers I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know they know they know
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize happened over time
She says "They miss the old Drake" girl don't tempt me
"If they don't get it they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know they know they know
They know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind that'll make them feel better
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone I'd rather be with you
Okay hold up wait a minute all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone got no patience 'cause I'm not a doctor
Yeah mi casa su casa got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes now the flow is so lava
Either the head is so hydra or we let bygones be bygones
"My God you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saddest shit is I'm bad as it
Sorry I'm just scared of the future
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone I'd rather be with you
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone I'd rather be with you
I used to care what people thought but now I care more
I mean nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it so insecure no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame we blow that like Coltrane
And when I'm long gone whole crew sing a swan song
And no matter where all of my friends go Emily Fam and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk at least I think so can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear they're not here
Assassins I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping I'm glad that it happened I mean it
Between us I think there's something special and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand even if you don't understand hol' up
Hol' up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone I'd rather be with you
Hol' up hol' up
Hol' up hol' up
Hol' up hol' up
Hol' up hol' up
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Every time she closed her eyes
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
La-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
I know the sun must set to rise"
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Every time she closed her eyes
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
La-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
I know the sun must set to rise"

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
Will he make it out alive? Alright alright no church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
All for Plato screech
Hova flow the Holy Ghost get the hell up out your seats
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
Will he make it out alive? Alright alright no church in the wild
I live by you desire
I stand by you walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah yeah
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Last night was mad real
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
Preach
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
Will he make it out alive? Alright alright no church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

Uh it definitely be mad important
And it would have to sound like a Prince song
Still a chain-smoking name dropping
Still a chain-smoking name dropping
Brain broken Frank Ocean listening stain hitting
Somebody pray for the god oh lord
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last Chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint
Still a chain-smoking name dropping
Brain broken Frank Ocean listening stain hitting
This part right here right now right here this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car I forget to park my whip
I lean back then spark my shit I turn up I talk my shit
Why toss my filter when she saving my life?
The same shit that kills us always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dealer God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me introduced me to the lucy leaf
Lies Levis on fire flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night in the sky I get higher higher
Still a chain-smoking name dropping
Brain broken Frank Ocean listening stain hitting
This part right here right now right here this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car I forget to park my whip
I lean back then spark my shit I turn up I talk my shit
I'm still a chain-smoking name dropping

Jone Quest
Wrapped in black cloth
I found by the bed
You're turning the lights off
And I am covering my face
You should do what you want
I can't stop you now and I won't try
Breathing slower now
We turn the TV back on
You should do what you want with him
But I don't want to see you with him
I can't stop you now and I won't try
I've been searching for a way to stay in dreams
But I'm waking up and feeling sick and feeling dizzy
It's always ending always ending always ending
Can we see
The beautiful
Pictures
Of your life
Projected on the side of a house
When fall comes
They'll find me
Covering
My eyes
In a pose reminiscent of a child
Scared of
The dark
But it's not the dark
That scares me
And when I go I
Give me
Back to
The sky
And keep me out of your dreams I have no place there
I have dreamt about what it's like to die
And I saw myself becoming shadows again
Just like I did when I was a kid
I saw my bones crack open and all the things I've been hiding from you spill out
All the secrets that i never thought I'd tell anyone about
I am warm and I am bored and I am drifting through this place
It's no better or worse than anything else that's ever happened to me
But I wish that I'd never met a lot of the people that I've met
Not because I don't like them but because I only let them down
And when you disappoint everyone all the time it's hard not to want to die
Constantly I feel this weird and shameful feeling
Like I'm being watched by a thousand glowing vengeful eyes
Behind one way mirrors in public bathrooms and in metro cars
And everywhere I go I know I'm not welcome
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out what's your address?
I'm your national anthem God you're so handsome
He loves to romance 'em reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom upper echelon
He says to be cool but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair hand on the back of my neck
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red white blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it it's a fact
Kiss kiss
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me King of Chevron?
He said to be cool but I'm already coolest
I said to get real don't you know who you're dealing with?
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red white blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
It's a love story for the new age for the sixth page
We're on a quick sick rampage
Wining and dining drinking and driving
Excessive buying overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well I can tell I can tell
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
I'm your national anthem
Boy put your hands up give me a standing ovation
Boy you have landed
Babe in the land of sweetness and danger Queen of Saigon
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red white blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the anthem
God you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
She fill my mind up with ideas
I see some things that you might fear
Legs wrapped around my beard
When I'm with you I feel alive
Won't cross my heart don't wanna die
This not the molly this the boot
Live the life of La Familia
Gorgeous baby keep me hard as steel
Ah this my life I did not choose
Uh been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh I fill my mind up with ideas
Case it's fumes
We're fucking in a car shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes I'd love it if we made it
Yes I'd love it if we made it
Yes I'd love it if we made it
And poison me daddy
I got the Jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone
A beach of drowning three-year olds
Rest in peace Lil Peep
The poetry is in the streets
Jesus save us
Modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes I'd love it if we made it
Yes I'd love it if we made it
Yes I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
Consultation
Degradation
Fossil fueling
Masturbation
Immigration
Liberal kitsch
Kneeling on a pitch
Excited to be indicted
Unrequited house with seven pools
The war has been incited
And guess what you're all invited
And you're famous
Modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part
For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart
I'll quote "on the road" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh I just had a change of heart
You smashed a glass into pieces
And that's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette
You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet
And she said "I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that"
You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart
I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh I just had a change of heart
Then she said "I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part 'this is how it starts'"
Oh I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
Oh I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
And she lays down on her bedroom floor
The chemicals that make her love
Don't seem to be working anymore
She tries her best but it hurts her chest
And even though her sun is gone
She'd like to love her child nevertheless
My hair is brown she's scared to touch
And she just wants to feel something
And I don't think that's asking for too much
And when I go to sleep it's when she begins to weep
She's appalled by not loving me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down
We got a plane oh to see my dad again
She prayed that we'd fall from the sky
Simply to alleviate the pain
Over water hmm
Over terrain
The engines all go bust we turned to dust
And I've no reason to complain yeah
And in the end she chose cocaine
But it couldn't fix her brain
She's appalled
Oh she doesn't love me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down
That was it
I've been watching you walk
I've been learning the way that you talk
The back of your head is at the front of my mind
Soon I'll crack it open just to see what's inside your mind
Inside your mind
Maybe I will wait until you're fast asleep
Dreaming things I have the right to see
Maybe you are dreaming you're in love with me
The only option left is look and see
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
I can show you the photographs of you getting on with life
I've had dreams where there's blood on you
All those dreams where you're my wife
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind

I'm in the furniture trade
Got a new job today
But stick the cretin
Went down the town
To a HM club
The sign had a cross
Through a couple well-dressed
They looked at my coat
They looked at my hair
An Easy Rider coot
Grabbed the edge of my coat
He was the manager
Up the stairs mister
Analytics have got
My type worked out
Analytics on me
The poison render
I grope about
And when I go out
My mind splits
My eyes doth hurt
The musical chairs
Have been swallowed up
By a cuddly group
Who land and rub off
Hoping that
Whatever it is
Will land and drop off
I met a hero of mine
I shook his hand
Got trapped in the door
Felt a fool I'll tell ya
Charmed to meet ya
Up the stairs mister
Became a recluse
And bought a computer
Set it up in the home
Elusive big one
On the screen
Saw the Holy Ghost I swear
On the screen
Where's the cursor?
Where's the eraser?
Where's the cursor?
Where's the eraser?
What's a computer?
What's a computer?

The powers that be will have to meet
And have no choice but to
Eat each other
Eat each other?
Portly and with good grace
His brain aflame
With all the dreams
It had conjured
Victim
Don't wanna be a victim
The centimeter square
Said it purged fear

WY Records
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears but boy they pour when
Do ya do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
No I don't like you I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet I don't get to fly it though I'm lying down
Do ya do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
You know you were my first time a new feel
It won't ever get old not in my soul not in my spirit keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
And tonight I'll hold you close close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Thought I found a way
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely all alone
Heart made of glass my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces skin to bone
Hello welcome home
Walking out of time
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely all alone
Heart made of glass my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces skin to bone
Hello welcome home
Yeah ah
Hello welcome home
Before the story begins
Is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine
Until the end of time?
We were more than friends
Before the story ends
And I will take what's mine
Create what God would never design
Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you
Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy eat it eat it eat it
She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in
It goes on and on and on
I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know I know it's not your time but bye bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
Baby don't cry
You had my heart at least for the most part
We fell apart let's make a new start
But baby don't cry
Now possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehave
Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears
Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize
From somewhere far beyond the grave
I gotta make up for what I've done
'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
While you burned in hell no peace forever
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know I know it's not your time but bye bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart at least for the most part
We fell apart let's make a new start
But baby don't cry
I will suffer for so long
To make it up to you
I'll do whatever you want me to do
And if it's not enough
If it's not enough
Try again
And again
Over and over again
We're coming back coming back
We'll live forever live forever
Let's have a wedding have a wedding
Let's start the killing start the killing
Do you take this man to death
For the rest of your unnatural life?
Do you take this woman to death
For the rest of your unnatural life?
I now pronounce you
'Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know I know it's not your time but bye bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry
You had my heart at least for the most part
We fell apart let's make a new start
But baby don't cry
Hooray I awake from yesterday
Alive but the war is here to stay
So my love Katherina and me
Decide to take our last walk
Through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to be reborn
Away from a life so battered and torn
Forever forever
Oh say can you see it's really such a mess
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lipstick tube-shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the Arctic stains
From silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find the sand and the sea
Is straight ahead straight up ahead
Well it's too bad that our friends can't be with us today
Well that's too bad
"The machine that we built would never save us"
That's what they say
And they also said
"It's impossible for man to live and breathe underwater forever"
Was their main complaint
"Anyway you know good and well
It would be beyond the will of God
And the grace of the King"
Grace of the King yeah yeah
So my darling and I make love in the sand
To salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine has done its work played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under we take a last look
At the killing noise of the out of style
The out of style out of style
So down and down and down and down
And down and down we go
Hurry my darling we mustn't be late for the show
Neptune champion games to an aqua world is so very dear
Right this way smiles a mermaid
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer
Atlantis full of cheer
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer
I lost my way oh baby this stray heart
Went to another can you recover baby?
Oh you're the only one that I'm dreaming of
Your precious heart was torn apart by me and you
You're not alone oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone oh I'll hold your heart and never let go
Everything that I want I want from you but I just can't have you
Everything that I need I need from you but I just can't have you
I said a thousand times and now a thousand one
We'll never part I'll never stray again from you
This dog is destined for a home to your heart
We'll never part I'll never stray again from you
You're not alone oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone oh I'll hold your heart and never let go
Everything that I want I want from you but I just can't have you
Everything that I need I need from you but I just can't have you
You're not alone oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone oh I'll hold your heart and never let go
Everything that I want I want from you but I just can't have you
Everything that I need I need from you but I just can't have you
Everything that I want I want from you but I just can't have you
Everything that I need I need from you but I just
Just can't have you
I think it's time we blow this scene
Get everybody and the stuff together
Yeah
I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I don't know if it's a phase I just wanna feel okay yeah
I battle with depression but the question still remains
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Okay yeah I struggle with this bullshit every day
And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
It obliterates me disintegrates me annihilates me
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm a popular popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular popular monster
I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace
I'm in a race against myself I try to keep a steady pace
How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
Yeah it's not a fucking stage I just wanna feel okay
Okay motherfucker now you got my attention
And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave
I am terrified I fell asleep at the wheel again
Crashed my car just to feel again
It obliterates me disintegrates me annihilates me
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm a popular popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular popular fucking monster yeah
Yeah here we go again motherfucker oh
We're sick and tired of wondering
Praying to a god that you don't believe
You're searching for the truth in the lost and found
So the question I ask is oh where the fuck is your god now?
'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm a popular popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular popular monster
I'm a popular popular monster
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
When he calls me I go crazy
He like me 'cause I'm wild camera phone in the shower
Sounds so good wanna turn it up loud
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I answer
A barking dog revved engine
Whatever catches your attention
It's your choice
Would you like to hear my voice?
Or is it hard to talk
When you're scared of where the call is coming from?
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I answer
I think I might be addicted to your kisses
We can do it now or later it don't make a difference
He sent me a text says "See you when you get here"
I was lonely last week but I won't be next year
On the phone with Ashley run shit like an athlete
We be at the game yeah but we never play them
He could be in danger I still wouldn't save him
I be in the front like Rudolph the Reindeer
I can tell you got a crush that's the reason why you came here
You ain't gotta lie just be honest with yourself
You wouldn't be here if it was for anyone else
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
And when he calls me I don't come home
Throw away my phone hide it somewhere no one knows
Buried it in the ground so it can never be found
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I answer
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I know
It's the only one I know it's the only one I answer
I was dying to find a way to kill time
Now you're gone and I can't ever say goodbye
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head
I'm thinking things I shouldn't say
You circled me inside my room
I couldn't go go go go
Oh my god what the fuck?
Take my hand crush it up
Spill the blood on the floor
I ain't scared think there's more
What the fuck? Make it stop
Took too long here right now
On the floor in the air
Smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think
I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside
You made it your mission yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one
But you just went and made it fun
It's not enough
You fucked up your last try
You were all work and I was all play and
I was on your hit list I felt the compression
I'll never go I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words when you write at all
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me I'd copy me too
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too copy me too
Copy me too copy me
I'd copy me too copy me too
Copy me too copy me too
I'd copy me too copy me too
Copy me too copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
I'd copy me too
All I need is a circle I can trust
Whoever leaves open eyes should see
Gives me more than just a reason to show I'm fine
And never have a reason to waste my time
And I'm open to the thought of getting by
But then she goes she goes by
In the corner of the sky
Like a seagull she flies high
'Cause she's always on my mind
What if I could be somebody else?
'Cause lately I've been thinking way too much
I was hoping you could take me away for good
I never had a reason to say I should
But I'm open to the thought of getting by
But then she goes she goes by
In the corner of the sky
Like a seagull she flies high
'Cause she's always on my mind
We played grown-up drowned in bathtubs
But you never opened up and I never said enough
And we broke it when silent
Slept on floors of angry mornings
But you never let me in so I stopped wanting it
Tearing every wall and breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule 'til all of me was yours
And pushing things aside but nothing ever worked worked
Now I know it wasn't right wasn't right
We pretended to hold it when quiet
And we blamed it on the time on the time on the time
And we broke it when silent
Tearing every wall and breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule 'til all of me was yours
And pushing things aside but nothing ever worked worked
Now I know it wasn't right wasn't right
We pretended to hold it when quiet
And we blamed it on the time on the time on the time
And we broke it when silent
Feel enough but you couldn't though
As you sat around a minute more
You or I hush some pointers
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Fucks it up like he couldn't be
Off for leaving you at secondly
All the wrong fortune adding up
As he grabbed a kiss to brush it off
Who would I laugh and point at
If you were to be avoided
And all the while to hate your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
All the way back in to a throe
Relishing in all the undertow
For tonight holding her to he
As she grabbed a kiss so tenderly
Why am I all for leaving
When you're the one I'm deceiving
And all the while I've hated your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
Your teeth
I saw you at the band stand looking pretty slammed
Did you see me feeding all my drinks to Cam?
Probably not I guess you were quite the mess
And that girl who tagged along there with you
I never caught her name but she seemed fucked up too
From where I sat she looked to be having fun
Keeping up with you just like I used to
I'm sorry to have ditched out but I was pretty high
Heard from Leslie that on his stumble home
Nat was puking up all that beer she'd drunk
You barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred hello
How she laughed with you just like I used to
I woke up to a pair of shoes I've not seen next to mine
Did you whisper as you crept in through the door
How you'd never done much like this before?
I was thinking back just the other day
Remember when we used to sneak out late to go and blaze
Seemed like loneliness was all we'd ever do
But now she's knowing you just like I used to
Over in the corner there
Sitting empty on the bathtub rail
And your toothbrush at my bathroom sink
Your cell phone chargers still hanging from the wall
So I have been using yours
From one of your health food stores
It is seemingly worsened everyday
All this shit of yours around my house
But it seems to wanna stick around
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby how fucked is that?
Yours is dented up and down the doors
Never wanted to see it more
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby how fucked is that?
But you won't find nothing there at a
